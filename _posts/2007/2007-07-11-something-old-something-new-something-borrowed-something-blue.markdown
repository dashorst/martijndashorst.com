<p>Remember that some of us were <a href="http://www.nabble.com/IBM-to-adopt-Wicket-as-standard-web-framework-t3467293.html" title="Nabble - Wicket - User - IBM to adopt Wicket as standard web framework">joking</a> about Big Old Blue three letter acronym<br />
with a market cap of about 1 gazillion dollars (which according to the latest<br />
exchange rates amounts to about 1 euro) was going to monopolize Wicket? Well,<br />
to many jokes there seems to be a small truth at its core.</p>
<p>It appears that Wicket has been on <a href="http://web.mac.com/jonathan.locke/iWeb/JonathanLocke/Blog/D3E5A1E8-2B29-4E90-A29D-A15F276642C6.html" title="IBM Discovers Wicket">big blue's radar</a> for some time. Moving to<br />
Apache certainly hasn't been bad for our reputation, and having graduated<br />
makes it easy for product managers to choose a web framework solution that is<br />
no longer an obscure project hosted <a href="http://sourceforge.net/" title="SourceForge.net: Welcome to SourceForge.net">sourceforge</a>, but a vibrant project,<br />
cleared of licensing issues and having a solid <a href="http://www.apache.org/" title="Welcome! - The Apache Software Foundation">foundation</a> at its core.</p>
<p>If you don't believe me (which I can imagine after the prank I pulled somewhere late march), read up on IBM's <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/edu/os-dw-os-ag-wicket.html?S_TACT=105AGX59&S_CMP=GR&ca=dgr-jw64ApacheWGD" title="Develop a simple Web application with Apache Wicket and Apache Geronimo">interest in Apache Wicket here</a> (registration <a href="http://www.bugmenot.com/view/www.ibm.com" title="IBM passwords - login with these free accounts to bypass compulsory web registration - Bugmenot.com">required</a>).</p>
