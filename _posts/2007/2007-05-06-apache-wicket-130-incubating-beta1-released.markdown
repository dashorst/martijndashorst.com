  content: Thanks for your hard work Martijn, including the 'work' you did at ApacheCon.
    It's exiting to see we're getting closer to graduation.

<p>A bit late for an announcement when it has already taken place a couple of days ago, but due to the fun on Apache Con it got lost in the activities. So here it is:</p>
<h3>Apache Wicket 1.3.0-incubating-beta1 released</h3>
<p>The Apache Wicket team is proud to announce Wicketâ€™s first Apache Incubator release. This release is officially <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/general@incubator.apache.org/msg13714.html">approved by the Incubator PMC</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Apache Wicket</li>
<li>This release</li>
<li>Migrating from 1.2</li>
<li>Downloading the release</li>
<li>Reporting bugs</li>

<p>We thank you for your patience and support. Next stop: graduation!</p>
<p> â€“ <em>The Wicket Team</em><br />
<h3>Apache Wicket</h3>
<p>Apache Wicket is a component oriented Java web application framework currently undergoing incubation at the Apache Software foundation. With proper mark-up/logic separation, a POJO data model, and a refreshing lack of XML, Apache Wicket makes developing web-apps simple and enjoyable again. Swap the boilerplate, complex debugging and brittle code for powerful, reusable components written with plain Java and HTML.</p>
<p>You can find more information on Apache Wicket here:</p>
<p><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/wicket">http://incubator.apache.org/wicket</a></p>
<h3>This release</h3>
<p>This release is a first in a series of beta releases until we feel confident to finalize Wicket 1.3. This is called a beta because we donâ€™t have fixed all bugs, and probably havenâ€™t found them all either (can you ever be sure?). However, we are confident that most major API changes are in and therefore want to give you access to a more stable platform than depending on trunk.</p>
<h4>Migrating from 1.2</h4>

<h3>Incubating Apache Wicket</h3>
<p>Apache Wicket is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>
