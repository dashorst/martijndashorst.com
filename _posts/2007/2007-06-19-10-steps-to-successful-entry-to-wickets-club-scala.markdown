<p>Our New York based, close Wicket follower and active blogger Nathan has found <a href="http://technically.us/code/x/the-escape-hatch">a new love</a>: Scala.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> is both functional and object oriented, and it can call into Java libraries. In his article Nathan describes how you can use the  language as a way to write Wicket applications with an apparent better fit than <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>.</p>
<p>As Nathan has written a rather long article, I'm not going to repeat him here. Check it out for yourself. If the book ever gets finished, I'll look into Scala, just as <a href="http://chillenious.wordpress.com/2007/06/19/writing-a-wicket-and-hibernate-application-in-scala/">Eelco promised</a>.</p>
<p>Interesting times for innovation in the language space. I can't wait to get my hands on both Groovy and Scala for a test drive.</p>
