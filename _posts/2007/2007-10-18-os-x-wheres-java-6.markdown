  content: you are so damn right!! Didn't Steve Jobs mention a few months ago that
    he considers Java to be dead (!!!!) or something similar.

  content: "Clearly almost all Apple's love goes to iPhone and iPod owners. Mac OS
    X is no more the best o.s. for Java development, being Linux much better - but
    Mac OS X is still be better o.s. on the whole, I mean especially if you need some
    other kinds of applications for your job or personal use.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,
    at this point, I wouldn't despair until October 26, and then we'll see. If no
    Java 6 will appear, we'll have to start another migration."

    or just intentionally trying to alienate Java developers?"

  content: Let's see for a few more weeks and see if Apple responds, otherwise my
    first work Mac will be my last, and I will start looking at getting back to using
    Thinkpads. Wonder if I still can use the Mac for Linux... But Linux runs so much
    better on the Thinkpad, and the Thinkpads actually give me more battery life,
    my switch to Mac was the for Mac OS X, so if running Linux (or god forbid going
    back to Vista), I see no reason to use a Mac.

<p>I've eschewed downloading the Java 6 developer preview from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/java/">Apple's Developer Center</a> since it was over a year old. And with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx">Leopard</a> around the corner, where is the much needed love for Java coming from Apple? Remember that OS X would be the number one Java development platform?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html">300 new features</a>, but no mention of Java. I'd <strong>really</strong> hate to take James Gosling's route and resort to <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jag/entry/solaris_and_os_x">using other operating systems</a> to be able to continue to work for my company (we're already deploying to Java 6).</p>
<p>The only quote I could find about Java on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/technology/64bit.html">Apple Leopard developer site</a> was:</p>
<blockquote><p>"You can even use 64-bit Java on capable Intel processors."</p></blockquote>
<p>Where's the love?!?</p>
