<p>I just wrote about <a href="http://martijndashorst.com/blog/2007/09/27/pages-in-iwork08-not-very-workable/#comments" title="A Wicket Diary&raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; Pages in iWork&#8217;08 not very workable">my troubles with Pages</a> and trying to write for Wicket in Action. Apple support is really quick: my blog entry was not up for longer than 8 hours, and they apparently already have fixed it!</p>
<blockquote><p>About Pages 3.0.1<br />
This update primarily addresses issues with change tracking and performance.</p></blockquote>
<p>I already figured it had to do with change tracking, as before we sent the documents to our editor, we had nothing to complain about performance. However, when we received our feedback, it came in a Word document that had change tracking on.</p>
<p>Installing the upgrade as we speak! Thanks to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/" title="Daring Fireball">John Gruber</a> for his update on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/" title="Daring Fireball">Daring Fireball</a>.</p>
