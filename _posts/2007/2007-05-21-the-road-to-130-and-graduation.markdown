  content: "Congrat To Wicket Team (can't wait to see the final release of wicket
    1.3). I've been trying wicket for a while and it's quite interesting. I found
    that develop using wicket in production would be so nice.  i also had written
    simpe article about developing wicket using eclipse in indonesian language, just
    to introduce wicket to newbie expecially in my own country. you can check it out
    @ http://dwiardiirawan.blogspot.com/2007/04/tutorial-wicket-framework-using-eclipse.html.\r\n\r\ncmiiw"

<p>It's official: we have a feature freeze for 1.3.0. This means only bug fixes should be committed to the repo and we should be heading steadily to a first release candidate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we still have several nasty open issues that need some serious TLC and we still have to graduate some day. Fortunately our community has voted to graduate from the incubator and we are doing all <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/guides/graduation.html">necessary steps </a>to get there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile other very interesting times are abound:</p>
<ul>
<li> a coworker has submitted a nice security framework for Wicket to the <a href="http://wicketstuff.org/confluence/display/STUFFWIKI/Wicket-Security">wicket-stuff</a> project.</li>
<li>Graeme Roche has created a Wicket Grails plugin</li>
<li>Peter Thomas (of <a href="http://jtrac.info">jtrac</a> fame) has compared JSF to Wicket in a <a href="http://ptrthomas.wordpress.com/2007/05/14/a-wicket-user-tries-jsf/">simple forum application</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On with graduation and 1.3!</p>
