<p>While perusing a series covering a <a href="http://cardbox.wordpress.com/tag/amazon-s3/">business model based on the Amazon S3 software service</a> I came across the following quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Outsiders do not realise how deeply technological development, like scientific research, is shaped and driven by emotion. [...] The reason that half of us are in computing at all is that <em>we see computers as things that we can make beautiful things out of</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And that really sums up my emotion when I am <del>building</del> creating software.</p>
