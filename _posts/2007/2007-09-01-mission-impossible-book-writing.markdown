  content: "Dude, in the first picture, looking too fast, I thought your shirt was
    the back of the chair ;-) j/k\r\n\r\nJoking aside, indeed it must be difficult
    to concentrate when a cute kitty snuggles up to you. I'm sure there are also 10,000
    other distractions that can delay writing a book!\r\n\r\nBut, you plow on, don't
    give up, you're almost there..\r\n\r\nGreat satisfaction awaits you !\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nFreddy"

    ball and chain is earning our bread and butter. I think chapter 5 will become
    available soon. I haven&#8217;t heard back from our editor that it is in need
