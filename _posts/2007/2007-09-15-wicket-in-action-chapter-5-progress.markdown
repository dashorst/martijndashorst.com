<p>
I've just submitted my hopefully last revision of chapter on models for the <a href="http://manning.com/dashorst/" title="Manning: Wicket in Action">Wicket in Action</a> book. With the help of Cynthia Kane (our fabulous editor) who was willing to lend me quite some time trying to overcome a writers block, I got the hang of it even though it took me a couple of days to revise it.</p>
<p>
I think it turned out really well. Now if Cynthia agrees, I suspect that the chapter will become available soon in the MEAP edition of the book. So please cross your fingers with me and hope for the best.</p>
<p>For now I start revising chapter 6, which is still based on Wicket 2.0.</p>
