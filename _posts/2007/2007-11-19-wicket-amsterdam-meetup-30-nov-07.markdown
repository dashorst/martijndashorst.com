<p>The Dutch <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/" title="Apache Wicket - Home">Wicket</a> community is trying to bootstrap a Wicket user group and organize a community meetup, similar to those held in <a href="http://jweekend.co.uk/dev/LWUGReg/" title="jWeekend">London</a> and <a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/community-meetups.html#Communitymeetups-Denmark" title="Community meetups">Copenhagen</a>. We expected a dozen, perhaps the odd 20 people attending, however reality often got the best of us (currently 57 and counting).</p>
<p>
November 30th, 2007 we will meet in Amsterdam in the <a href="http://www.felixmeritis.nl/index_eng.php" title="Felix Meritis">Felix Meritis</a> building starting with setup at noon and going full swing from 3pm until we are done or the host throws us out.</p>
<p>
You can register at our <a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/community-meetups.html#Communitymeetups-TheNetherlands" title="Community meetups">community meetups</a> page, just add your name to the list.</p>
