<p>The next hurdle towards graduation has been overcome: the Incubator Project Management Committee has approved to ask the Apache Board to establish "Apache Wicket" as a top level project.</p>
<p>This is mumble jumble to say: should the Board accept the resolution on their next meeting, Wicket will become a full fledged Apache project. The next board meeting is <a href="http://people.apache.org/calendar.html">scheduled for June 20</a>.</p>
<p>When that happens a number of things need to be done before we are where we want to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>http://incubator.apache.org/wicket needs to go to http://wicket.apache.org</li>
<li>move the user mailing list over to Apache</li>
<li>move the repository from http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/wicket to http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/wicket</li>
<li><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/guides/graduation.html">etc.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please join me in thanking the Incubator PMC for their trust bestowed in the Wicket community. We will not disappoint you!</p>
