  content: The toughest part of writing a technical book is the last few weeks.    Somehow
    the amount effort required to pay attention to the details grows exponentially
    over time.   Good luck, and don't sacriface too much sleep.

<p>Both Eelco and I are working hard to get the <a href="http://manning.com/dashorst/" title="Manning: Wicket in Action">book</a> out. Trust me when I say that the people most anxiously awaiting the final chapter are Eelco and myself. The book has been a millstone around our necks for a while now and you can't imagine the personal toll we both have paid whilst writing this book.</p>
<p>The book itself is progressing good. Our editor will post a new version of the MEAP the coming week with updates to chapters 1 through 4 and a brand spanking new chapter added to the mix: chapter 6. <a href="//chillenious.wordpress.com/">Eelco</a> just released a new version of chapter 12 and is waiting for comments.</p>
<p>I'm in the process of chopping chapter 7 (Forms) from 38 pages to a more manageable 28 or so.</p>
<p>Like I said in a previous post: "Goed schrijven is schrappen" (To write well is to scrap)</p>
