  content: I thought that was a skunk at the top at first.  Good luck with the new
    software.  I run wordpress, too, and love it.

  content: "It is liberating, isn't it? I think everyone who cares about the Internet
    should have at least one or two domains and full access to the servers or scripts
    backing them.\r\n\r\nI don't know why I don't run WordPress myself, except that
    I thought until this moment that it cost money (like Movable Type). I guess I
    like running Typo just to be moderately on top of what's going on in rubyland.
    But it's inevitable that I'll write my own weblog software. I'm just trying to
    postpone that immense intrusion on my life for as long as possible."

  content: Nice mr! Maybe I should do this sometimes too. I've had this server for
    1.5 years sitting around costing (some) money without ever really touching it.
    Shame on me!

<p>With a flick of a switch I moved my blog from <a href="http://jroller.com/page/dashorst">jroller</a> to my own hosted <a href="http://martijndashorst.com">wordpress powered blog</a>. The movers did a great job at packing all my stuff here into nice boxes, and moving it to my new place, including the comments. Even though the moving service was very professional some china may have been broken.</p>
<p>Now why bother moving, and shelling out money for a service that is available for free? Several things triggered me to do the switch:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>speed</strong>: jroller has its bad days when it comes to speed. It hosts several hundreds of blogs and needs to serve them all.</li>
<li><strong>editor compatibility</strong>: several blog editors exist, but most of them don't support the roller api. I'm typing this message using Flock, the social browser. Probably it is possible to direct Flock to be able to post to jroller, but I didn't want to work with a half baked solution.</li>
<li><strong>own domain</strong>: I like being master of my own little universe, probably a left over from watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He-Man">He-Man</a> too much during childhood).</li>
<li><strong>wordpress</strong>: I think it is the best blogging tool around at this moment. Some of the templates are beautiful (vertigo squared, jillij) and more are available. On top of that the spam prevention for comments (akistmet) is great.</li>
<li><strong>statistics</strong>: being master of my own domain I get statistics for free with my subscription. Who, where from, when, etc.</li>
<li><strong>greener grass</strong>: when I read the blog of Nathan, I immediately thought: that is what I want: more control, more freedom</li>
</ul>
<p>So here we are: on <a href="http://martijndashorst.com">martijndashorst.com</a>. I'm still contemplating splitting the <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> part from my own private life ramblings. However, if I promise to keep the main writing about Wicket with a peek now and then into my personal stuff would you mind?</p>
<p>Soon to be launched: A Wicket Diary at http://wicketdiary.org</p>
