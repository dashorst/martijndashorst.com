Eelco and I have delivered chapters 2 and 4 to the Manning Early Access Program (MEAP) for our <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/" title="The Nobel Prize in Literature">award winning</a>, upcoming book <a href="http://manning.com/dashorst">Wicket in Action</a>. I think these two chapters complement chapters 1 and 3 pretty well.</p>
<p>
	Chapter 2 discusses the Wicket key concepts, whereas chapter 4 uses these concepts and builds a (gawk!) online web shop. Highly original, I'm sure, but it fits the bill quite nicely. And not in the very least, it helps Eelco with his home sickness, being in Seattle, devoid of any ...... he lingers for sooo much...</p>
<p>
	Thank you all for your comments and improvements and nitpicking! If you have written a chapter, and rewritten, and rewritten it, one can't help to get a blindness for language mistakes such as unfinished sentences, wrong words in wrong places and so forth.
