<p>Our London delegate, <a href="http://herebebeasties.com/">Al Maw</a>, is organizing a <a href="http://herebebeasties.com/2007-06-14/london-wicket-users-group/">Wicket meetup</a> in London. If you want to celebrate the imminent graduation of Wicket to an Apache top level project, this is your chance to meet, greet Al and other Wicket community members.</p>
<p>The meeting is scheduled for July 3rd, and pending enough interest. Please announce that you are interested in the meet up in <a href="http://www.nabble.com/London-Wicket-Users-Group%2C-July-3rd---interested--tf3924587.html">this thread</a>.</p>
<p>Get out of the closet, detach that mouse from your fingers and join the Wicket User Group!</p>
