    do you happen to have some nice \"built with Wicket\" banner images I could use

<p>
With Wicket's recent <a href="http://martijndashorst.com/blog/2007/06/20/3-2-1/" title="A Wicket Diary&raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; 3&#8230; 2&#8230; 1&#8230; Apache Wicket">graduation</a> we had become homeless: the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/" title="Apache Incubator">Incubator</a> didn't<br />
want us anymore (you're <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/guides/graduation.html#life-after-graduation">graduated, get out</a>!), and our TLP was not yet<br />
established. In the mean time, the universe seemed to conspire against us:<br />
lethal solar flares tried to divert infrastructure's attention to burning<br />
machines. But we prevailed!</p>
<p>
Behold... our new home:</p>

<p>
Many thanks go out to the infrastructure team at Apache.</p>
<p>
	There are still a <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-1278" title="[#INFRA-1278] Create Apache Wicket TLP - ASF JIRA">couple of remaining items</a>, but they will be dealt with accordingly and soon, as long as there are no new tricks from the Universe to hold us back!</p>
