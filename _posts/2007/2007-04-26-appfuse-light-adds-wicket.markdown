    guidance. In fact he says: \r\n\"If you're a developer of one of the frameworks
    that AppFuse Light uses - I'd love a code review to make sure I'm \"up to snuff\"
    on how to use your framework. I'm also more than willing to give commit rights
    if you'd like to improve the implementation of your framework.\"\r\n\r\nSo, it
    is an opportunity to promote 1.3.0"

<p><a href="http://raibledesigns.com/">Matt Raible</a> adds <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> to the list of supported projects to the <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/appfuse_light_1_8_beta">AppFuse Light project</a>. Too bad he didn't show which version is added (1.2.6 or the upcoming wicket 1.3.0).</p>
