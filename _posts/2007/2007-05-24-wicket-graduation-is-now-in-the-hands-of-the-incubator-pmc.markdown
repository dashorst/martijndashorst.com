<p>The Wicket graduation proposal has been put in front of the Incubator PMC. This basically means that the Incubator project management committee (IPMC) will decide whether they approve of Wicket becoming a top level Apache project.</p>
<p>You can monitor the proposal here: <a href="http://www.nabble.com/-VOTE--Graduate-Apache-Wicket-from-the-incubator-tf3811378.html">[VOTE] Graduate Apache Wicket from the incubator</a>.</p>
<p>The process is now as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the IPMC votes on our proposal for graduation</li>
<li>if successful, the proposal is submitted to the next Apache board meeting (june 20th)</li>
<li>if accepted, we will start transfering the WIcket project to its top level location and migrate the lists, repo, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might wonder how releases are done in the mean time? Well, we will continue to issue releases, but they will continue to pass the IPMC before we can make them available (though I expect not too many delays in this procedure). </p>
<p>This is an extra burden, but one we need to go through until we are graduated. After graduation we can cut down a bit on the release times, as the Apache Wicket PMC is then responsible for the releases.</p>
<p>Onward with graduation!</p>
