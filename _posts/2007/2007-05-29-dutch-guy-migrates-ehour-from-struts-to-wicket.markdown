<p>Thies Edeling migrates <a href="http://ehour.nl">eHour</a>, an open source, web based time tracker application, to <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> and gives a detailed <a href="http://blog.ehour.nl/index.php/archives/category/moving-into-wicket/">how to guide</a>. Especially for new developers this seems like a good place to monitor as Thies migrates more elements of his application.</p>
