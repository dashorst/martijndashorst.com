<p>It seems that around Valentine's day and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival">carnival</a> the Java open source community is very generous with sending gifts to the general public: first <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket 1.2.5</a> saw the light, and now we can reap the benefits of months of ploughing through <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10500&amp;styleName=Html&amp;version=12294">issues</a> by the Maven team.</p>
<p>The Maven project released the long awaited <a href="http://maven.apache.org/release-notes.html">Maven 2.0.5</a>. Congratulations and celebrations.</p>
