  content: I don't know of any really common names, I think the names are just picked
    randomly, like "Nancy".  There is a brand which itself is called TomTom; I don't
    know if anyone calls it by that if they own one.  I refer to a handheld hiking
    GPS unit as a "jeepers"

  content: Not sure about in the US, but in the UK it's generally referred to as "satnav",
    if you don't call it TomTom or whatever.

  content: Cryptically enough, I usually call it a "GPS".  Same with all the people
    I've ever talked to about the units.  Occasionally it'll be referred to by it's
    brand (e.g. "Garman"), but that's far less common than the simple acronym.

  content: Sorry for the (dutch) language, but I call her 'navigatieslet', which in
    English would be 'navigationslut'.. I know, bad language, but a collegue started
    using it, now everybody here does.

    of GPS's and have never really noticed anyone calling there GPS by a special name.
    \ If you are still looking for a name email me, I'll be glad to ask my customers..\r\n\r\n\r\n-Brad\r\nhttp://www.supergpsstore.com"

<p>OK, here's the problem with today's internet and google search results: it is one giant heap of commercial poop. Since I don't have too many friends in the US and don't live there, I have to use google for research on popular American culture. At least for those things we don't see on TV, youtube and in movies.</p>
<p>Today I was looking for pet names for an electronic device: the GPS car navigation system. In Holland we typically call it 'Truus'. Now if you query google with "pet name gps" you get advertisements for gravestones for your late pets, or personalized gps tracking devices for your pet. I only found one link telling that they petnamed their GPS system 'Betty'. That sounds right, but only one reference is not really pop culture!</p>
<p>So how do <i>you</i> call your GPS navigation system?</p>
