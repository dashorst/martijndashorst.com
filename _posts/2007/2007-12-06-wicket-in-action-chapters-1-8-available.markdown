  content: Great news! However I am a bit disappointed because they did not pick my
    cover design. :)

  content: "re. your comment on Stephen Fry's blog about Uno;\r\n\r\nI have looked
    at this solution in the past, but having looked at the way it changes settings
    within the system itself, I wouldn't be happy doing it in case something were
    to go wrong, meaning I had to reinstall the OS. (That and I've put up with it
    for 18 months - I'm sure I can manage another few weeks until I've scraped together
    the cash for Leopard!)"

  content: heh... well, I've installed it (after having the same reservation as you),
    but when I sit behind the macbook of my wife I really can't get over the ugliness
    of the brushed metal. I'm not sure if this will hinder my installation of Leopard
    or not... But I do like the unified look.

The book Eelco and I are writing, [Wicket in Action][1], is getting
together quickly. As of today the MEAP edition consists of 228 pages
worth of Wicket gold.

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/uploads/wicket_in_action.jpg" alt="Wicket in Action" height="480" /></p>

We have added chapters 7 and 8, concluding the second part of our book:

- Chapter 7: Using forms for data entry
- Chapter 8: Composing your pages

Chapter 7 describes everything you wanted to know about form processing
and validation. Chapter 8 describes how you can group components using
`WebMarkupContainer`s, fragments and panels, and describes the various
ways of composing your pages to get a consistent layout across your
whole application.

[Get it][1] while it is fresh! And as always: comments are welcome on
the [Author Online forum][2].
