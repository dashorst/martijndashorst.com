  content: "[...] It&#8217;s somewhat &#8220;encouraging&#8221; that Martijn seems
    to have the exact same problem that I have. At least it&#8217;s not just me. Whenever
    I plugin in my Logitech USB headset it&#8217;s very(!!) likely that I have to
    restart my machine right after. It just freezes OSX. I could not reproduce this
    on my a Powerbook G4 and it seems also be OK on newer machines with Leopard. But
    with my current machine running Tiger it&#8217;s a PITA. [...]"

  content: Logitech used to be a good name for keyboards and trackballs in the Mac
    world. Judging from their apparent total lack of interest in providing OS X drivers
    for their webcams, I'd suggest steering clear of all their products -- who knows
    how long they'll be supported?

<p>
I am the (currently not so proud) owner of a Logitech 250 USB headset that gives my patience a run for its money. Whenever I revive my Mac Book Pro (first generation core duo) and plug the USB headset into one of the USB ports, OS X grinds to a halt.</p>
<p>
I'm not the only one who <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=5800509" title="Apple - Support - Discussions - Freeze when connecting Logitech USB ...">faces this problem</a>. I can attest to the experience in that support discussion: it doesn't matter in which USB port I plug the headset, or even if it is linked through my cinema display's USB hub. The only thing I can add is that this happens when my mac book has been asleep.</p>
<p>
Last time I complained on this blog about a thing that bugged me on OS X, it got resolved pretty quickly, so here's hoping for us Logitech 250 owners!</p>
