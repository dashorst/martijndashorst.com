  content: "Martijn,\r\nThanks for mentioning our London Wicket User Group. \r\nWe
    now revert back to holding our meetings on the first Tuesday of every month, starting
    on Tuesday, October 2nd, 2007. \r\nThe registration page (built on Wicket, JPA
    and JavaMail) is also back at the original location (  <a href=\"http://jWeekend.co.uk/dev/LWUGReg\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">at jWeekend.co.uk</a>). \r\nRegards - Cemal\r\njWeekend.co.uk\r\nPS
    Wicket In Action is looking really good, more strength to your elbow! I will contact
    Manning next week about how we can best arrange to give the early access ebooks
    to our students."

<p>The <a href="http://londonwicket.org/" title="jWeekend">London Wicket</a> user group is doing its monthly get-together tomorrow (wednesday). There are still some places left. From what I understand the topics covered tomorrow are quite interesting: a dynamic sexy form, and you can complain to our own London delegate <a href="http://herebebeasties.com" title="Alastair Maw">Al</a> about anything as long as it is <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/" title="Apache Wicket - Home">Wicket</a> related or his long and frequent vacations. The location is kindly provided by <a href="http://www.skillsmatter.com/" title="SkillsMatter   : Skills Matter Agile, Java, Open Source Tech">Skillsmatter</a> and you can register <a href="http://jweekend.co.uk/dev/LWUGReg">here</a>.</p>
