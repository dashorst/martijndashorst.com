    <strong>Wicket =&gt; Apache Wicket...</strong>

    Wicket has graduated from Apache Incubator and has now become an Apache top level project. I would like to thank all the guys who made this possible and especially Martijn (our new PMC Chair). I&#8217;m trying to plan a little get-together/meeting in C...

    my own Wicket projects for a while, but now it&#8217;s time get working with Irrigator
    again, and make my heating controller better adapted for use with mobile phones.
    I used fancy Ajax stuff for it&#8217;s very simple GUI, not realising that the
    Sony-Ericsson phones doesn&#8217;t do Ajax&#8230; Silly me. Now where&#8217;s

  content: Wow. Excellent news. Congratulations to all. I bumped into Wicket a year
    and quarter back and  must admit that i was impressed with it and recommended
    to my colleagues though i could not sell it. Over the last year it has gained
    significant mileage and with this announcement i feel we have a strong case.

    to see that your hard work with Wicket is rewarded; I hope the Apache brand will
    further expand Wickets use around the globe. It's been a while since I have used
    Wicket (I am not doing much web programming for now). but Wicket is my first pick
    when I will make web apps again, as I really like the clean separation of HTML
    and Java, and the no-brainer way to Ajax-enable your app.\r\n\r\nCongratulations."

We have Graduation! The <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> project is established as the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/wicket">Apache Wicket</a> project within the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.</p>

	Subject: Apache Board Meeting, June 20, 2007 (new officers!)
	Date: Wed, 20 Jun 2007 12:45:06 -0700
	From: Greg Stein
	Reply-To: members@
	To: members@

	Hi all,

	Today, the newly-elected Board met for the first time. After we got
	done with our regular series of project reviews and other reports, we
	elected a new slate of executive officers. I'm happy to present that
	list:

	 Jim Jagielski, Chairman
	 Justin Erenkrantz, President
	 J Aaron Farr, Treasurer
	 Sam Ruby, Exec VP and Secretary

	Welcome guys to your new offices!

	We also established new three projects:

	* Apache Quetzalcoatl: this springs mod_python and related bits out of
	the HTTPD project into its own TLP. Gregory Trubetskoy is its Chair.

	* Apache Wicket: this is a light webapp framework for Java, graduating
	from the Incubator into its own TLP. Martijn Dashorst is the new
	Chair.

	* Apache Commons: this is the venerable Apache Jakarta Commons, now
	spun out into its own TLP, with Torsten Curdt as its Chair.

	Finally, we swapped a couple PMC Chairs:

	* Will Glass-Hussin replaces Henning Schmiedehausen as the Velocity Chair
	* David Sean Taylor replaces Santiago Gala as the Portals Chair


	That's it for this month. Please feel free to forward this to any
	public/private forum as you see fit. If you have any questions, then
	please don't hesitate to ask myself or any other Director or officer.

	Cheers,
	-g

From this rather obscure blog, I would like to congratulate all Wicket community members with this remarkable feat! Furthermore, I like to thank the Board of the Apache Software Foundation for the trust they invested in us. We will not disappoint!</p>
<p>
I personally would like to thank Wicket's mentors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex Karasulu (whose birthday coincidentally is today... what a better gift could you receive). Thanks for bringing us on board!</li>
<li>Upayavira, who made the transition even run smoother than thought possible. Thanks for guiding us and I hope you'll stay for a long time with our project!</li>
<li>Bertrand Delacretaz, thank you for your help, votes and advise. We will miss your involvement, but will certainly see you in the future!</li>
<li>Sylvain Wallez, also big thanks for helping and guiding us. I hope Wicket is still working within Joost</li>
</ul>
<p>
Finally, congratulations to the new officers, PMC Chairs and the other two new projects: Apache Quetzalcoatl and Apache Commons! Welcome to the club!</p>
