  content: I'm glad to hear that there is a RC release, but really at some point in
    time you guys need to release a production version.  Someone needs to decide what
    is really important to be added to 1.3 and what can be pushed to a 1.3.1 or 1.4
    release instead of creating beta after beta...the community it waiting!

<p>Johan has noticed Wicket has over <a href="http://www.nabble.com/passed-the-600-unit-tests....%21%21-tf4741583.html" title="Wicket - passed the 600 unit tests....!!">600 unit tests</a> in place.</p>
<p>And our first release candidate is under way for Wicket 1.3. This weekend Frank will start the release process of the 1.3.0-rc1! Will Santa arrive with a special gift for all?</p>
