<p>I'm still working on my own paycheck and it is getting lonely, fortunately I have a cat that <a href="http://martijndashorst.com/blog/2007/09/01/mission-impossible-book-writing/" title="A Wicket Diary&raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; Mission Impossible: book writing">keeps me company</a> during the day when the <a href="http://dianadashorst.com/" title="Diana's website">ol' ball and chain</a> is earning our bread and butter. I think chapter 5 will become available soon. I haven't heard back from our editor that it is in need of some tender loving care, so that is promising.</p>
<p>I uploaded my third revision of chapter 6 yesterday and I hope to get some feedback today or tomorrow (she is <em>fast</em>). Chapter 6 is about the basic components: displaying text, linking to pages and documents, linking to actions and using the basic repeaters. It is hard to make such a range of topics readable and keep it together. Basically chapter 6 is 5 separate chapters crammed into one.</p>
