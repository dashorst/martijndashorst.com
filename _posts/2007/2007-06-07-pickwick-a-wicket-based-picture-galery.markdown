  content: "Quietly, yes because it is not ready to be used ;). It is just the very
    beginning, i,e, nothing in the backend is developped yet...\r\n\r\nAs you made
    some buzz around PickWick, we need to work hard and quick to provide asap features
    listed on PickWick wicketStuff ;)."

<p>Our newly appointed <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> (P)PMC member <a href="http://blog.caraldi.com/jbq">Jean-Baptiste Quenot</a> has <a href="http://blog.caraldi.com/jbq/2007/06/07/buildr-a-very-nice-beginning-to-replace-maven/">quietly</a> started a new project called <a href="http://wicketstuff.org/confluence/display/STUFFWIKI/Pickwick">PickWick</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pickwick is a Wicket-based photo gallery.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides a set of basic pages to render the pictures, organized in folders (called sequences)</li>
<li>Uses a nice URL displaying the folder name relative to the images directory</li>
<li>Back-office application to edit the photo gallery</li>
<li>Thumbnails and scaled images are generated on disk to avoid the complexity of caching systems</li>
<li>ImageMagick support, for maximum efficiency and to reduce the memory footprint of the JVM</li>
<li>Java2D support</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this begs the question: is it a hobby or something used within <a href="http://joost.com">Joost</a>?</p>
