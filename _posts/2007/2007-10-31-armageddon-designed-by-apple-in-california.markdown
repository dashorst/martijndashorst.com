<p>No, this is not yet <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t102936.html" title="So Long Apple. The Party's Over">another rant</a> about missing the Mustang in Leopard. The unofficial Apple weblog writes about the <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/10/30/the-icomet/" title="The iComet - The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW)">iComet</a>, which is a picture of a comet in the shape of the Apple logo.</p>
