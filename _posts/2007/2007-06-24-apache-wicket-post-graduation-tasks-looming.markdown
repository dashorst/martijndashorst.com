With <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/wicket">Apache Wicket</a>'s graduation <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=45880">extravaganza</a> last week, we are settling down again and contemplating what needs to be done to establish ourselves on the Apache grounds of http://wicket.apache.org.</p>
<p>
We already knew that our framework was pretty decent, but hearing mostly <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=45880#235022">positive comments</a> on a usually web framework hostile forum as The ServerSide.com, is really comforting.</p>
<p>
You can monitor the progress here: <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-675">JIRA-675</a> as we progress through the issues.</p>
<p>
Probably the hardest part will be to migrate all subscribers the the Wicket User list that is still hosted on sourceforge.net. We will see if you all need to re-subscribe to the Wicket user list or if the only action you need to take is changing your gmail filter.</p>
