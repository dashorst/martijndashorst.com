<p><a href="http://blog.caraldi.com/jbq/">John Banana Qwerty</a>, or as we like to call him, Jean-Baptiste Quenot, has been <a href="http://www.nabble.com/VOTE%3A-add-Jean-Baptiste-Quenot-as-a-comitter-to-Wicket-tf3192195.html">sworn in</a> to the inner circle of the Wicket core committers. As soon as we wave a dead chicken in front of our monitors he'll be granted enough karma to do something about our bug list, and add a couple.</p>
<p>JBQ is mostly known within Apache for his work on <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Cocoon</a>, but currently is the chief Wicket guy for <a href="http://joost.com">Joost</a>.</p>
<p>Welcome JBQ!</p>
