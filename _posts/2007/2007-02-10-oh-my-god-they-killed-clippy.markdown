  content: Clippy was my only friend! He was such a good listener, I used to talk
    with him for hours. And now he is gone :( He was the only one who really understood
    me. I guess I will never upgrade to 2007 version for I cannot live without Clippy!

  content: "Nooooo! I was heartbroken when I installed Office 2007 and realized Clippy
    was gone. He was the first one I looked for. Why did they have to kill the poor
    little guy :((??? I mean, he came with a \"disable\" option for those who were
    fully grown up...\r\n\r\nBut I'm still 5 years old and I want my Clippy back!"

<p>This time I agree completely with the Microsoft marketing department: Microsoft Office 2007 is the best Microsoft Office for 10 long years. But I probably have other reasons than they have. Finally they <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/02/09/microsoft-clippy-rip-1997-2007/">removed the annoying paperclip</a> from the suite.</p>
<p>Clippy-be-gone-forever.</p>
<p>Now, if they also ditched that infuriating search dog in Vista that plagues Windows XP...</p>
