    It is the first thing we're concentrating on. We do think that we'll need just
    one before we go to release candidates.

    <strong>Incubator progress pushed forward by Atlassian Bamboo...</strong>

    I just came across this blog from a couple weeks ago. From the Wicket Diary blog, you can follow the links to the Bamboo project: In the mean time we have our......

<p>We are still working hard to get a beta release of (Apache) Wicket 1.3 out the door in the next weeks. We have to <span>receive</span> some license grants of a couple (2 iirc) persons before we can ship the release.</p>
<p>In the mean time we have our own server (kindly provided by <a href="http://servoy.com">Servoy</a>) provide us with a confluence and JIRA setup for <a href="http://wicketstuff.org">Wicket Stuff</a>, and best of all: <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/">Bamboo</a> for building and pushing new development builds to the box. The installation of Bamboo on the server and hooking it up provided a push for fixing our builds. Johan, Igor and Frank have worked hard to get the build to complete.</p>
<p>This means that we finally have running 1.3 examples. If you want to see the latest and greatest in action, you can look here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wicketstuff.org/bamboo">Bamboo builds</a> for the build status</li>
<li><a href="http://wicketstuff.org/wicket13/">Live Wicket 1.3 examples</a></li>
<li>Wicket 2.0 examples (still needs work to be deployed successfully)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, Wicket 1.3 is maturing and getting stable. We will be able to ship it soon and let you enjoy the <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310561&amp;styleName=Html&amp;version=12312114">new features</a>, and visit our new, temporary, <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/wicket">home at Apache</a>.</p>
<p>As a member of the Wicket team, I would like to express our gratitude towards <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> for providing their software gratis to the Wicket community.</p>
