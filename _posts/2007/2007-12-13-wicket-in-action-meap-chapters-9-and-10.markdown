<p>I have a premonition that you will be able to snuggle up in front of your CO<sup>2</sup> neutral fireplace sipping a nice cup of hot chocolate with a freshly printed copy of <a href="http://manning.com/dashorst/" title="Manning: Wicket in Action">Wicket in Action</a>'s chapters 9 and 10 this weekend.</p>
<p>If you are in a more warmer climate (it is freezing out here) you can read them in your hammock on the porch looking at a nice sunset, sipping a martini.</p>
<p>Keep checking your inbox tomorrow!</p>
