<p>The weekend is saved! You can download and read two (2) new chapters of <a href="http://www.manning.com/dashorst/" title="Manning: Wicket in Action">Wicket in Action</a>, provided that you have bought the <acronym title="Manning Early Access Program">MEAP</acronym> edition of the upcoming  book. Subscribers to this edition can now download the newest additions: chapters 2 and 4.</p>
<p>
Chapter 2 introduces the concepts of Wicket and gives a really nice overview of what you can expect when building applications with Wicket. To drive things home, chapter 4 builds an online Cheese store, covering quite a lot of subjects. The topics covered in these two chapters should give novice Wicket users a solid foundation for the remainder of the book, but provide enough small little gems for more experienced Wicket developers, if only a fresh look at how you did things up till now.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.manning.com/dashorst" title="Wicket in Action">Go get it now</a>, before they run out of stock of these chapters! I heard there was only a limited supply of chapter 4, as it uses about 36 pages.</p>
<p>
If you are interested in a sampler of what we write, you can always download the freely available <a href="http://www.manning.com/dashorst/meap_wicketch1.pdf">Chapter 1</a>.</p>
