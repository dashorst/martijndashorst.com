<p>Last night when you were prancing around with your friends I was fixing the issues our fabulous editor found in chapter 6. At 1am I uploaded the chapter to our workspace with Manning and sent the relieving message that it is ready for another round of review.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is all about the basic components. It goes through text producing, navigating with links, action links and repeating markup with repeaters. I think it came out pretty well. With the help of our editor I was able to shave some pages off, and make things more succinct. So instead of 5 pages regarding visibility it is now 2.</p>
<p>This review will be quick (fortunately I didn't have to modify much) and I think you'll see the chapter ending up in the MEAP in a week or two.</p>
