<p>Is the <a href="http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/03/newroo_job_open.html">MySpace digg.com clone</a> going with the <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket framework</a>? I know the original founders of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/02/03/newroos-real-time-news-aggregator/">Newroo</a> were Wicket users and their business proposal was built using Wicket 1.1. Given that they <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/09/it-looks-like-myspace-will-finally-do-something-with-newroo/">allegedly sold the company for $7 million</a> to <a href="http://news.com">News Corp</a>, that would be the most expensive Wicket application I know.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://myspace.com">MySpace</a> is the worlds biggest website (according to <a href="://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/09/it-looks-like-myspace-will-finally-do-something-with-newroo">TechCrunch</a>), this would be a nice boost to Wicket's fame. If only because their first prototype in Wicket gave them enough credibilty to get noticed and acquired.</p>
<p>BTW, they are hiring and want some Wicket talent:</p>
