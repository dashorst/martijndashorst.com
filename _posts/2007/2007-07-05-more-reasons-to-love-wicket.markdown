  content: "Hi,\r\nfor me wicket sounds good. In our company we have developed an
    App-Framework with PHP and I had a look on  tapestry an JSF, but I don't like
    the XML-configration nightmare. \r\nNow the things I'm waiting for are an Appl-Framework,
    using Wicket, with the standard things done, like user authentication, configurable
    access to functions  and views and one special component would be great, an editable
    table/spreadsheet like Goggle Spreadsheet. Nothing is more convenient than having
    the possibility to edit data in a spreadsheet than to edit each dataset ot its
    own. regads mikel"

<p>The list season is on! In a response to Xavier's <a href="http://xhab.blogspot.com/2007/07/top-10-reasons-why-you-should-try.html">top 10 reasons</a> to choose Wicket, <a href="http://jlawmi.blogspot.com">James</a> goes beyond that and provides us  with a list of reasons to love Wicket. He has worked with Wicket for just about 12 hours, and already has <a href="http://jlawmi.blogspot.com/2007/06/reasons-to-love-wicket.html">13 reasons to love Wicket</a>. Here's reason number 4:</p>
<blockquote><p>â€œreal re-use. Using every other framework, reuse at the UI layer has been nearly impossible, or at least broken. In struts you could re-use forms, but ended up copying jsp crap around. In wicket, you can make subclasses of existing components (like a panel) that contain your bus specific version of it.â€</p></blockquote>
