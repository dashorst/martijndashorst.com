  content: "Nicer error pages for mismatched component hierarchies. If it's in the
    markup only, send the plain template over (to be rendered, not escaped) with the
    stranded element having a red border. If it's in the page hierarchy only, send
    out a tree with the relevant hierarchy in it and the stranded component outlined
    in red. Neither page should require horizontal scrolling or very much paging-down
    to find the problem. ;)\r\n\r\n(Obvs, I've thought about doing this myself! But
    who knows if I'll get around to it.)"

<p>What would constitute good <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> improvement projects for <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/02/speaking-of-summer.html">Google's Summer of Code 2007</a>? Here's a list I just came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>add support for new markup languages: WML, XUL, ...?</li>
<li>create visual editor for Eclipse, Netbeans or IntelliJ?</li>
<li>create <a href="http://jroller.com/page/JonathanLocke?entry=more_evidence_wicket_is_fast">comprehensive scalability/performance tests</a> between Wicket, JSF and Tapestry</li>
<li>expand/improve on <a href="http://wicket-stuff.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/wicket-stuff/branches/WICKET_1_2/wicket-kronos-cms/">Wicket Kronos</a>, a Wicket based CMS</li>
<li>write a reference manual or a doclet for generating one from our JavaDoc</li>
<li>write a conference planner for <a href="http://apachecon.com">ApacheCon</a> in Wicket</li>
<li>...
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is just a short list, and I guess there are much better ideas than what I came up with. Share your ideas!</p>
