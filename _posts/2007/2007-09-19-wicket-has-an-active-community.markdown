<p>It is no secret that Wicket sports one of the most active open source communities in the Java space. If you only look at the mailing list activity hosted on Nabble, you can see that Wicket's lists put it on the <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Web-Development-Framework-f16257.html" title="Nabble - Web Development Framework forum">number one spot for web development frameworks</a>, and number three spot of <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Java-Software-f787.html" title="Nabble - Java Software forum">Java related projects</a>. Only a whole aggregated community (Java.net) and Netbeans are in front of it.</p>
<p>But that is not what this post is about. Our <a href="http://londonwicket.org">London chapter</a> has held a couple of community sessions in the past few months (I've announced several of them a couple of times here). This has made more folks enthusiastic about bringing this to more places, including the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark. To keep track of these community meetups we now have a <a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/community-meetups.html" title="Community meetups">registration page</a> on the Wicket wiki where you can show interest, or add your own local Wicket initiative.</p>
<p>Please check our <a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/community-meetups.html" title="Community meetups">community meetings</a> page out and add yourself to one of the meetups or organize one of your own!</p>
