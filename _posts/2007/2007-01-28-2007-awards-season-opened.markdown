<p>Yes! The Oscars are on its way, and Java developers can do their own voting for things important in your day to day job instead of some fantasy woman (such as <a href="http://oscars.com/nominees/?pn=detail&amp;nominee=CruzPen%E9lopeActressLeadingRoleNominee"><span>PenÃ©lope</span> Cruz</a>). You can express your support for your favorite Java open source project at the following locations (and I know yours is <a href="http://rubyonrails.org"><strike>Ruby on Rails</strike></a> <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/wicket">Wicket</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www2.sys-con.com/java/readerschoice2004/framevote.cfm">Java Developers Journal 2007 Readers' Choice Awards</a> (note the 2004 in the URL) and win a FREE years extension of your subscription. (<small>looks like this is only for subscribers</small>)</li>
<li>The <span>java</span>.com <a href="http://java.sun.com/community/dukeawards/dukesChoice_form_new.html">Annual Duke's Choice Awards</a></li>
<li>The <span>sourceforge</span>.net <a href="http://sourceforge.net/awards/cca/">Community Choice Awards</a> (site still is for 2006)</li>
</ul>
<p>Do I miss the <span><a href="http://javalobby.org">JavaLobby</a></span> and <a href="http://java.about.com"><span>java</span>.about.com</a> yearly polls? Of course, <a href="http://theserverside.com"><span>TheServerSide</span>.com</a> has about a two-weekly polls where <span>JSF</span> gets trashed as being to complicated, Tapestry for being built up from start with every major release, Wicket for being to server memory hungry, Struts for being too old <span>skool</span> (or dead), RIFE for having ugly templates and so on. Perhaps they should create an award for the most uninteresting, uncriticized open source enterprise project.</p>
<p>What about the new comer: <span><a href="http://infoq.com">infoq</a></span>, do they start a annual award soon? Or <a href="http://jroller.com/page/fate"><span>Hani</span> Suleiman</a> with an annual crap award (sort of the <span><a href="http://www.razzies.com/">Razzies</a></span> for Java software)?</p>
<p>I want to see some awards!</p>
