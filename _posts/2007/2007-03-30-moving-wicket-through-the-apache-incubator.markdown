<p>The <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/wicket">Wicket project</a> is undergoing <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/wicket">incubation at Apache</a> and we have entered the next stage. The last couple of agonizing weeks we have tried to mold our project and maven build to behave to our expectations.</p>
<p>The title 'incubator' is very fitting as I think the hours of missed sleep while nursing our project and taking care of our build seem similar to a new born child (don't have one yet, but I notice the dark edges around the eyes of new fathers often enough).</p>
<p>We managed to get our release wrapped and vetted by our community. Just a hour ago I submitted our incubator release to the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/guides/pmc.html">Incubator PMC</a> and try to get it approved. Note that this release is not for the general public, and I won't provide a link to it (the code base itself is already 2 weeks old, so you'd better <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/wicket/building-from-svn.html">build from our development stream anyway</a>).</p>
<p>When this release gets approved by the IPMC, we will have solved our legal issues, and we can then ask for graduation, provided we match the other exit criteria.</p>
