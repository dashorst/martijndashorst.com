  content: "After 2 months struggling with JSF I found the path to Wicket. No more
    seeking for unexplainable bugs and problems. Wicket's lack of XML is heaven for
    people who like to code instead of editing descriptors and configuration files.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for this great framework!\r\n\r\nSoma\r\n\r\nps: When do you expect wicket to
    graduate from incubation?"

  content: "I have been using wicket since it was .something :). I started using it
    in late 2004, I was looking at tapestry too, but wicket caught my heart more,
    I've used it for many application in my work (with db4o), now, I have wrote almost
    8 application with it, I work with IOM (www.iom-iraq.net), and we help Iraqis
    in Iraq and out side, wicket has been used for applications that manage Medical
    Evacuation, manage Assisted Voluntary Returns to Iraq, and more. More is coming
    in the way.\r\n\r\nAll what I want to say is thank you wicket team, I truly appreciate
    the excellent work, wicket is how web applications should be, I O you guys big
    time! ;)"

  content: Thanks for those comments Soma and Ali.  When you make something as abstract
    as Wicket, it's nice to hear that it's making a difference.
