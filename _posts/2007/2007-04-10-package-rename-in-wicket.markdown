<p>The ball has dropped: we are now in Apache turf! Johan tortured his Eclipse installation, harddrive and CPU to perform a package rename from our old trusty "<code>wicket.*</code>" package to the soon to be appropriate "<code>org.apache.wicket.*</code>" package names.</p>
<p>Johan says:</p>
<blockquote><p>after this commit my laptop is at least 2 years older then before i started it</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm just waiting to have the unittests become stable again to package another incubator release. This will probably be the last Wicket feat in the incubator, apart from voting on graduation.</p>
