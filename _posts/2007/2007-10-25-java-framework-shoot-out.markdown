<p>Fred Daoud has <a href="http://www.jroller.com/javelotinfo/entry/trolling_with_java_web_frameworks" title="Fred Daoud's Weblog : Weblog">written a different take</a> on the Language Wars trolls. This time it is about the endless war and trolling between the various web frameworks that occur on the various community websites and even between blogs.</p>
<p>Priceless comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>
	<strong>JSF (hanging his head)</strong>: &lt;f:verbatim&gt;Sorry..&lt;/f:verbatim&gt;</p>
<p>	<strong>Wicket</strong>: Hey JSF, race you to write a custom component! GO!</p>
<p>	<strong>Facelets</strong>: hold on now.. (dials cell phone).. let me call Seam and see what we can do.. find a vendor..</p>
<p>	<strong>Wicket</strong>: FINISHED! I win!
</p></blockquote>
<p>And I also broke out in laughter reading further:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>RIFE</strong>: (starts to say something)</p>
<p><strong>(somebody interrupts)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moderator</strong>: quiet, RIFE was talking, let him finish!</p>
<p><strong>RIFE</strong>: No problem, I can easily continue what I was saying.. (finishes what he was saying, using a different template syntax, er, a different accent..)
</p></blockquote>
<p>(this is of course a priceless reference to RIFE's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation" title="Continuation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">continuations</a> support).</p>
<p>To fully appreciate the discussion, read the <a href="http://www.jroller.com/javelotinfo/entry/trolling_with_java_web_frameworks" title="Fred Daoud's Weblog : Weblog">whole framework discussion here</a>. It'll put a smile on your face!</p>
