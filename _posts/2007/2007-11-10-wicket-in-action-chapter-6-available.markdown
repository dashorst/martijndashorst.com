<p>Manning has just updated the MEAP and released chapters 1 through 6 of <a href="http://manning.com/dashorst/" title="Manning: Wicket in Action">Wicket in Action</a>. This time we have new versions of the early chapters with a much improved chapter 1.</p>
<p>Please note that this is preproduction material and the images in the document are not great looking (we do have higher resolution images).</p>
<p>On a side note, chapter 7 should make its way the coming weeks. I delivered it again today to our editor and she'll make a final judgment soon. But I think she will share my enthusiasm for this chapter.</p>
