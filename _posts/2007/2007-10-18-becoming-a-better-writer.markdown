  content: "Nice post.\r\n\r\nI also like, if you're *really* stuck, a major writer's
    block, then just let your writing spill out without worry, without editing, without
    re-reading; just write and write and write. Then, throw it out write again; things
    will come out better the second time than if you stay stuck in the rut and try
    to get it write the first time (and getting nowhere).\r\n\r\nOf course, this doesn't
    apply to every chapter you are writing. I'm not suggesting to always throw out
    your first draft! But, for those particular rough patches, sometimes it helps
    to just clean out the clog.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Martijn, keep up the good work on WIA.
    Looking forward to reading it.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nFreddy"

<ol>
<li>Get to the point, goes hand in hand with:</li>
<li>Cut down your text (MD: "Goed schrijven is schrappen", lit. Good writing means scrapping)</li>
<li>Write a draft. Then let it rest (MD: works wonders for code too!)</li>
<li>Be relatable and honest</li>
<li>Don't care too much what others may think (MD: though listen to your editor!)</li>
<li>Read a lot</li>
<li>Write a lot (MD: writing more gives you a better style, and makes you more proficient)
<p>I can relate to these points a lot. Though I don't have enough time to read, and writing a draft to leave it for a couple of months is not an option anymore.</li>
</ol>
