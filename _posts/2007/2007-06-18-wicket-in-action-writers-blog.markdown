    you guys felt the API changes more than anyone.

<p>I've been awfully quiet with writing about Eelco's and mine endeavor to deliver our first (and probably last) book: Wicket in Action. As Eelco <a href="http://chillenious.wordpress.com/2007/06/15/getting-wicket-in-action-ready-for-meap/">mentioned last week</a>, we are getting the manuscript ready for <a href="http://www.manning.com/about/meap.html">MEAP</a>ing. This also means picking a <a href="http://technically.us/code/archive/2007/6#item-561">cover for our book</a>, and I think we made the right choice. If you ever get touch of us, and are curious why we picked <strong>that</strong> specific cover, just buy yourself and us a beer (Eelco likes whiskey), and don't hesitate to ask :) I can tell you that our cover is <i>smokin'!</i></p>
<p>As for the writing, it currently has gained speed again. The chapters are being revised to cover the reversal of the <a href="http://martijndashorst.com/blog/2007/03/15/curtain-closes-for-wicked-constructor-change/">constructor change</a> (and you thought you were the only one being bitten by that!), and keeping up with renaming efforts of other team members. We expect to have chapters 1 through 4 available in a couple of weeks, which is dependent on us giving the chapters a final last make over and handing them over to the production team.</p>
<p>When that happens, we will ping you <a href="http://martijndashorst.com/blog">here</a>, <a href="http://chillenious.wordpress.com">there</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/everywhere">everywhere</a>!</p>
