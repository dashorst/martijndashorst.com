It has been 5 years since [Maurice Marrink and his brother Michel
passed away](/blog/2008/08/a-farewell-to-maurice-marrink)
after a tragic car accident. I can't imagine the pain and loss their
parents and their sister must feel even after these years.

Maurice's legacy is still around me everyday. His code and his cultural
contributions to my company still live on. We regularly have nerd
nights and other activities, and almost everyday when I look at the
code I'm working on I see his signature:

{% highlight java %}
/**
 * @author marrink
 */
{% endhighlight %}

So almost every day I get to work with Maurice even though he is no
longer with us. Sometimes it is just in passing, often times it stings,
but it is never unnoticed.

My thoughts are with his family and I hope they find solace in that
Maurice is still with us, and that we miss him.
