<p>
We are moving the <a href="http://wicket-stuff.sf.net/wicket-kickstart">Wicket Quickstart</a> project to the core <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a> project. The quickstart project allows you to quickly start experimenting with Wicket.</p>
<p>When I need to test something from say the examples, then I just download and unzip the quickstart distribution and copy/paste the examples code into the project. This allows me to quickly see whether code still works.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should create another <a href="http://wicket-stuff.sourceforge.net/wicket-kickstart/demos/EclipseDemo.html">movie</a> showing how to do this.</p>
<p><b>Wicket 1.1-rc1 is coming!</b></p>
<p>We are currently busy looking at the open issues, and try to solve them. Later this weekend we will release the first release candidate for <a href="http://wicket.sf.net/wicket-1.1">Wicket 1.1</a>.</p>
