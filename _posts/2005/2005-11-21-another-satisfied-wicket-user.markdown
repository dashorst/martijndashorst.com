<p>
Brent Roberts <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/m91955205#91955205">likes working with Wicket</a>, and I've never even seen a message from him on our mailinglists. There are probably a lot of users that aren't vocal, but using <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a> silently.</p>
<p>I like hearing succes stories, so share them!</p>
