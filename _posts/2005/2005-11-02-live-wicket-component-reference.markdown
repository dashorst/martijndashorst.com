<p>
For all of you who would like to learn more about <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a> components, we have an excellent live <a href="http://www.wicket-library.com/wicket-examples/compref">component reference</a>, showing you what each component does, and how you can use it.</p>
<p>
If you want to have this at home, then it is very simple: download the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=119783&package_id=138752">Wicket Examples</a> project and deploy the war file from the distribution in your favorite application server. The component reference can be found at the root page of the web application.</p>
