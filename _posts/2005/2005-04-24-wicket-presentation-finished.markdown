<p>The <a href="http://wicket.sf.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a> presentation I was <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/dashorst/20050424#writers_block" title="previous blog">writing earlier about</a> is finished. It took a lot of will power to create it and I hope it resembles anything good. Perhaps I will be putting the presentation on the web, but that is not certain at this time.</p>
<p>In the mean time, why don't you look at the <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net/ExampleHelloWorld.html" title="Hello World Example">Hello World Example</a> of the <a href="http://wicket.sf.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a> project.</p>
