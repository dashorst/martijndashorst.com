<p>How often do you have both JSF guru Ed Burns and Tapestry founder Howard Lewis Ship advertising for <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net">Wicket</a>? If you haven't been to the smackdown, you didn't only miss this remarkable feat, but also a highly amuzing, fun and entertaining panel discussion. This was majorly different from the coma inducing portlet vendor expert panel and I'm glad that <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2005/06/ed_burns_javaon_6.html">Ed Burn's concerns for the smackdown</a> didn't come into being.</p>
<p>It was really great to see these five guys stabbing one another below the belt whenever possible and making minced meat from the MVC frameworks ('Struts is Dead, move on', Dave Geary). So if you have been to the smackdown and you want to comment on it, do so here, or on the <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t19337.html">discussion on the JavaLobby</a>.</p>
