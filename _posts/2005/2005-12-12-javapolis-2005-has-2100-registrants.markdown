<p>The belgian <a href="http://www.javapolis.com">JavaPolis</a> has 2100 registrants! Even though this is not as huge as the JavaOne conference with its 14000 registrants, this is <em>VERY</em> impressive. I'll arrive tomorrow evening and hope to do some work on the presentation <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/eelco12">Eelco</a> and I are going to give.</p>
<p>We hope to see you there! And I'll try to update this blog with any news items I can gather during the conference...</p>
