<p>Finally some information concerning the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/maven2">Maven 2</a> project. It was really quiet for almost a year! A lot of development has gone into the project, and I haven't run the project yet, but I'm really exited to try it. The new features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCIES</strong></li>
<li>increased performance due to Java code plugins</li>
<li>stopped doing double work (jar:jar will only create a jar, from what is in the build dir)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Too bad they don't have the site generation in place yet as this is the feature I use most. Kudos to the maven2 team!</p>
