    The nicest thing that I can say about Wicket right now is that I haven't had much to say about it.  It's been so productive and enjoyable to work with that I've been fleshing out <a href="http://recipe.homeip.net/app">applications</a> based on it, rather than writing blog articles!

    I hope to have some nice OSS and articles on Wicket in the future, though.  This thing is really shaping up to be a nice framework.

<p><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/geertjan/">Geertjan Wielenga</a> is quite busy writing down his experiences with <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a>. A quote from his message to our <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/wicket-user%40lists.sourceforge.net/">user list</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The last few days I've blogged about nothing but Wicket, which rarely happens -- I tend to jump around from topic to topic.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>It is always nice to hear someone using your product and becoming very enthousiastic about it!</p>
