<p>
The vote is in... Coming weekend we will be shipping RC2 of the <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a> java web application framework. A lot of problems with the first release candidate are solved, and while some issues are still open, we feel we can't postpone a new version much longer.</p>
<p>
As the popularity of <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a> seems to be growing, the pressure to finalize the 1.0 release grows. It seems I have to disappoint my girlfriend for this weekend again ;-).</p>
