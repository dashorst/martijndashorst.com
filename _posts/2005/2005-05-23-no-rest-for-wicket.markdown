<p>:-) There is no rest for the <a href="http://wicket.sf.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a> project. Since we've basically finalized our 1.0 development (all that remains is flushing out possible breakages between RC2 and RC3), development has started on features for <a href="" title="Roadmap">Wicket 1.1</a></p>
<p>With <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/" title="JavaOne">JavaOne</a> coming up, and with <strong>2 presentations</strong> concerning <a href="http://wicket.sf.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a>, both <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/eelco12" title="Eelco Hillenius">Eelco</a> and I are quite busy preparing ourselves for the presentations:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://www28.cplan.com/javaone05_93_1/session_details.jsp?isid=271642&ilocation_id=93-1&ilanguage=english" title="Web framework smackdown">Web Framework Smackdown</a> - Tapestry, JSF, Struts Shale Webwork and Wicket fight it out</li>
<li><a href="https://www28.cplan.com/javaone05_93_1/session_details.jsp?isid=271617&ilocation_id=93-1&ilanguage=english" title="Introduction to Wicket">POJO Web Development with Wicket</a> - Miko Matsumura and myself</li>
</ul>
<p>See you at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/" title="JavaOne">JavaOne</a>!</p>
