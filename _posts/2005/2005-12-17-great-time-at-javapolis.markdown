<p>We had a great time at JavaPolis in Antwerp. We renewed a lot of contacts we had made on JavaOne, and got some new friends. And as a plus to all the belgian beer, we even learned some new things!</p>
<p>The things that stood out most were IMO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aspect oriented programming: it is really becoming mainstream with the adoption of AOP by Spring and the integration they will provide in Spring 2</li>
<li>Distributed caching: I <em>really</em> enjoyed talking to Cameron Purdy on the proposition his company provides for distributed caching. As our company is in the business of building ASP (not the M$ term) web applications, their product seems quite interesting</li>
<li>King Kong: the classic has been treated with respect and will enable new generations to enjoy this love story. Peter Jackson did it again.</li>
</ul>
<p>A great thanks to Stephan Jansen for making this happen!</p>
