The Wicket team is proud to announce the availability of <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket 1.1</a> for download! Wicket is a Java component oriented web application framework that takes simplicity, separation of concerns and ease of use to a whole new level. Wicket web applications consist of HTML markup and Java classes. No strange languages, no strange markup, no configuration files, no specialized, expensive tools: just Java, HTML and you.</p>
<p>
This Wicket version contains a lot of improvements from the 1.0 version. New features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplified feedback and validation - enables custom feedback strategies</li>
<li>Live Component Reference - the examples project contains a component reference showing how to use the components.</li>
<li>JavaScript and CSS support for components - contribute JavaScript and CSS from your component to the using page</li>
<li>Markup Inheritance - enables template pages and components</li>
<li>Inclusion of external markup</li>
<li>Simplified Choice component</li>
<li>Advanced Table components - easily generate pageable/sortable tables backed by database or any other datasource in wicket-extensions (graduated components from wicket-contrib-dataview)</li>
<li>Less dependencies - we removed several library dependencies</li>
<li>Customizable Form handling - easy for quick forms, easily enables full custom form processing</li>
<li>Improved resource handling</li>
<li>Date picker component - will not get you dates, but a JavaScript and text field enabled localized calendar component.</li>
<li>Improved URL handling</li>
<li>AJAX request handling support - support for two leading AJAX JavaScript libraries is available as separate downloads from our Wicket Stuff project: scriptaculous and DOJO toolkit</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Wicket team wishes to extend their gratitude to the user and developer community for their testing efforts and help, making this release a reality!</p>
