  content: I look forward to attending your presentation on Wicket. I have tried to
    sit down and spend some time with Wicket but, work projects have been hectic.
    I am sure your presentation will give me that little boost I need in the right
    direction... :)

<p>The <a href="http://wicket.sf.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a> presentation for <a href="https://www28.cplan.com/javaone05_93_1/session_details.jsp?isid=271617&ilocation_id=93-1&ilanguage=english">JavaOne 2005</a> is finally done. It was hard work to get the examples and the rest working the way I want it to be, so I missed several hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Next on my list is either get a good nights sleep, or starting the writing process on the Wicket article I mentioned earlier on this blog. Anyway, my weekend seems already filled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Releasing Wicket 1.0</li>
<li>Writing an article</li>
<li>Stop worrying about the maximum number of 650 people that will hear me stutter in English :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>I will post some highlights of the presentation at a later moment, so you can get as excited as I will be (though I doubt you'll be just as nervous).</p>
