<p>Oh the joys of being a core contributor to an open source project. <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a> has enjoyed two new releases: a bug fix release on the <a href="http://wicket.sf.net/wicket-1.0">1.0 branch</a> and a new release of the <a href="http://wicket.sf.net/wicket-1.1">Wicket 1.1</a> branch.</p>
<p>Things are looking good though. A number of AJAX experiments are already under construction, and portlet support is finding its way into Wicket. The first baby steps have been done and we are going to finalize 1.1 soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we could use your help on testing Wicket 1.1, so go to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=119783">SourceForge downloads section</a> and download our newest beta release!</p>
