  content: And even if you want full round robin clustering support, you can have
    it. Just without the 'redirect after submit' pattern (you have to set another
    render strategy in the application options).

<p>We are going to release <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a> 1.0-rc3 these coming days. I've got to find the right moment to perform the build and deploy it to sourceforge. In this new <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a> release you won't find <em>new</em> features, but almost all  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=119783&amp;atid=684975" title="bugs">bugs</a> are solved and we are confident we will be able to squash the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1190222&amp;group_id=119783&amp;atid=684975" title="last bug">last one</a> in a reasonable amount of time. Perhaps we won't be able to solve it completely before we go ahead and declare 1.0 final, but then again, not everybody needs <em>round robin clustering</em> support.</p>
<p>I've also got to install a new wiki and convert the old data of the current wiki to the new one.<br />
