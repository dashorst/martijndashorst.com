<p>I chickened out at the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/webmink/20050621">blogger meetup</a>: I didn't want to end up like <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/page/rd/20050622">Bileblog Hani</a> just before my session on JavaOne, so I left when they started issuing car bombs. Sorry Matt!</p>
<p>All in all it was very interesting to meet the bloggers out there in person and it was pretty neat to meet Matt Raible, even though he can be quite annoying ;-). My esteemed collegue <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/eelco12">Eelco Hillenius</a> is heading out right now to meet them and hold up the Wicket honour (I hope Matt forgot to bring his camera).</p>
