    I was wondering if they did.  TSS must do the same thing.  It is a horrible practice.   Like all "gestures", it (moving about) should match what you are saying.  (BTW, my father and father-in-law are professional speakers [ministers] and I was in training to be one.  I had a great speech professor for two semesters.)

    So move about - but use it wisely.

<p>Just finished a rehearsal of my presentation and it went pretty well. Speaker coaching is really good here and they make you feel much more up to the task of addressing all you guys :-). I have no doubt it will be a fun and interesting experience.</p>
<p>Now my last problem (I hope) is to find my co-speaker, <a href="http://www.miko.com">Miko</a>, and go through the last stuff. Does it effect your karma to meet with your cos-speaker, just 15 minutes before the talk?</p>
