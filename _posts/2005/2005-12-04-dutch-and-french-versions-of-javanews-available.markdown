For those that like to read Java content in their native tongue, the JavaNews magazine has been translated into <a href="http://www.javapolis.com/JP05Content/javanews/N_JAVANEWS2005.pdf">dutch</a> and <a href="http://www.javapolis.com/JP05Content/javanews/F_JAVANEWS2005.pdf">french</a>. If you wish, you can also download the <a href="http://www.javapolis.com/JP05Content/javanews/JAVANEWS2005.pdf">english version</a>. To quote from the dutch frontpage:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>"Martijn Dashorst bekijkt het leven door een roze bril dankzij Wicket"</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Which translates roughly into english as:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>"Martijn Dashorst looks at life through pink glasses thanks to Wicket"</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a (bad) english translation from a dutch proverb. Strange language, that dutch... I guess the translator got enthousiastic about my 3D-glasses I wear on the picture.</p>
<p>The picture with the 3D glasses comes from a vacation Diana (my girlfriend) and I spent in Florida. We were at the Kennedy Space Center, and were just about to see a 3D spaceshuttle movie. Here's the whole picture:</p>
