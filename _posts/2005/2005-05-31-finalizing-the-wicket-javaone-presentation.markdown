<p>Right this moment I'm putting away my .Net development project and start working on the last stage of my <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a> presentation on <a href="https://www28.cplan.com/javaone05_93_1/session_details.jsp?isid=271617&ilocation_id=93-1&ilanguage=english" title="Wicket JavaOne Presentation">JavaOne 2005</a>. I have had little sleep the last few days, and am on a tight schedule as the presentation is due tonight. Hopefully I won't run into any problems with my laptop or the network. Within a few hours you will see a message of great relieve when I've finally send my presentation to Sun. Starting tomorrow I'll be working at the aforementioned article concerning Wicket (of course in my spare time, as work on my current .Net project continues).</p>
