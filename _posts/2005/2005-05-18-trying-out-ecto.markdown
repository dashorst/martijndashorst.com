<p>As I've committed myself to the Apple platform, I'm in need of a new blog editor. <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/" title="Ecto">Ecto</a> seems like <em>the way</em> to go. As it is both a Windows client (laptop from work needs Windows) and OSX, and it supports roller as a blogging server, this program almost seems too good to be true.</p>
<p>I'm trying this one out with this message, so don't expect too much information <em>yet</em> on the forthcoming <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a> release candidate.<br />
