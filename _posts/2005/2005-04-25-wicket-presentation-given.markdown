    This sounds interesting... are there any plans to make the presentation materials public?  I'd be curious to see a detailed comparison of these three frameworks.

    Don't feel too bad about the gaffes, such things are to be expected in early presentations for fresh technologies.

    I hope the outcome is good for you!

  content: I am planning to put the presentation online. Just don't know where to
    put it yet, and the current form just isn't good enough IMO. Keep looking at this
    blog for updates. Possibly also the Wicket main site.

<p>I finally presented <a href="http://wicket.sf.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a> to my esteemed collegues at <a href="http://www.topicus.nl" title="Topicus">Topicus</a>. The presentation didn't go too good. First I didn't get the benefits of Wicket good in the picture, why it is so much better than Tapestry and JSF (read on), and as a bonus, I hit on a minor <a href="">bug</a> while ad-libbing the addition of a delete object button to my sample application. This I hadn't exercised, so in complete compliance to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law">Murphy's Law</a>, an abominable stack trace showed up in my browser. Nice one when one of your collegues is a JSF supporter!</p>
<p>I will have to work on the presentation before I give it to the public as I am not quite happy with the way the presentation flowed.</p>
