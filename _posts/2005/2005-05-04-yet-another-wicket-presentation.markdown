  content: web.xml is mandated by the servlet spec. So we can't skip that one... But
    you will have to search hard for any other XML or property configuration file
    imposed by Wicket.

<p>I just created yet another presentation for <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a>. It is a 5-10 minute introduction into Wicket. I don't know when I'll put this on the web, because it first needs to be presented to a larger audience at some conference later this summer.</p>
<p>It is <em>hard</em> to introduce something complex as Wicket in 5-10 minutes. I tried to focus on what Wicket is (an open source Java component based web application framework) and what the <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net/Features.html">main features</a> are.</p>
<p>Is this enough? It is not possible to get 'Wicket' across by showing code for 5 minutes. Most people won't be able to grasp more complex code than <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net/ExampleHelloWorld.html">'Hello World'</a> in 5 minutes, and though interesting, it <em>really</em> doesn't communicate half of what Wicket is all about. Sure, we can brag about the <font size="+1">lack of XML configuration files</font> (which is shown by the Hello, World example), but Wicket is more than that. If you want to find out now, then check out the <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net/Examples.html">other examples</a>, or why don't you give Wicket a <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net/QuickStartBinary.html">try yourself</a>?</p>
