<p>For my employer, <a href="http://www.topicus.nl" title="Topicus">Topicus</a> I need to give a presentation concerning <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a>, the new Java web application framework. I've been willing to do so for a couple of weeks, and last monday I couldn't postpone it any more, so I sent the invitations to all Topicus employees. Now I only need to deliver and that is pretty hard... I should stop writing this blog and go work in the presentation.</p>
