<p>This week has multiple goals: preparing for my <a href="https://www28.cplan.com/javaone05_93_1/session_details.jsp?isid=271617&ilocation_id=93-1&ilanguage=english<br />
" title="Wicket on JavaOne">Wicket presentation</a> on <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/index.jsp" title="JavaOne 2005 SF">JavaOne 2005</a> in San Fransisco. Writing an article, more actively looking at the <a href="http://wicket.sf.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a> mailing lists as <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/eelco12" title="Eelco Hillenius">Eelco</a> is in the Denver mountains (how will he survive without WIFI?) and accompanying demo application and just plain old work in .Net.</p>
<p>The article is coming along just fine: I'm aiming not to write the obiquous 'Hello, World' type of article, as we already have a <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net/ExampleHelloWorld.html" title="Hello World Example">nice example of this</a> on our website, but to show how one creates custom, rich, high level components. The application won't show any persistency stuff, as it will take too much time to introduce Wicket, show component development and show some persistency related stuff. That may become yet another article, if this one turns out ok.</p>
