<p><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/geertjan" title="blog">Geertjan Wielenga</a> has <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/geertjan/20050428#kickstart_wicket_in_netbeans_ide" title="Kickstart Wicket in NetBeans IDE 4.1">blogged</a> about running the <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a> <a href="http://wicket-stuff.sourceforge.net/wicket-kickstart/index.html" title="Kick Start">Kick Start Project</a> in <a href="http://www.netbeans.info" title="NetBeans">NetBeans</a>. Check the Kick Start project out if you wish to jump start your Wicket development, and use the description of Geertjan to do so in NetBeans. Other IDE's currently supported are: Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA (for IDEA: temporary download <a href="wicket-kickstart-1.0.zip">here</a>).</p>
<p>It is not by intention that we don't currently support NetBeans, we just aren't NetBeans users. It is a matter of preference, taste and like it/hate it (this also goes for Eclipse, which also has many followers and haters). Perhaps someone will <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t17830.html" title="JavaLobby">switch to NetBeans</a> when the 4.1 release comes out?</p>
