<p>Eelco reminded me to take a look at the guestbook example on the <a href="http://www.wicket-library.com">Wicket Library</a> to see whether anybody was trying it out. Well, here's a list of comments posted there:</p>

6/29/05 Det Ã¤r trÃ¶ttsamt att lÃ¤ra sig en ny programmeringsmodell. Vad fÃ¥r jag hÃ¤r som fattas i de som jag redan anvÃ¤nder?

6/24/05 Hi, someone reading this???.. :-OOO</pre>
<p>This blog is the answer to the last question: Yes we read (sometimes) the guestbook.</p>
<p>I don't know what the Danish, Norwegian or Swedish comment means, I hope it is not some plug for a wicked site.</p>
