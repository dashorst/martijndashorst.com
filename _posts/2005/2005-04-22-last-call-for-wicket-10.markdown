<p>Wicket needs your input!</p>
<p>The Wicket team is preparing the final <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a> 1.0 release candidate.<br />
Therefore we need your help. If you have things that are hard for you to<br />
accomplish using Wicket, if there is something you posted to the<br />
mailinglist and it didn't get resolved, if you have a killer idea that<br />
absolutely must be in 1.0 or else...</p>
<p>Send it to the mailinglist or create a bug report!</p>
<p>The Wicket team want the RC3 to be the final release for Wicket 1.0.<br />
After this, development will focus on creating 1.1 with full support for<br />
AJAX, JavaScript, CSS and more.</p>
<p>This is the final call for changes to Wicket 1.0.</p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<p>The Wicket Team</p>
