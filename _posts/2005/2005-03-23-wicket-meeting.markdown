<p>Finally the long anticipated meeting of the minds for the <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a> project is taking place. Jonathan, Juergen, Chris, Eelco, Johan, Jan and me are currently at the <a href="http://www.topicus.nl">Topicus</a> office discussing a new implementation for a <code>ListView</code>, clustering, documentation and other stuff important for Wicket.</p>
<p>My employer, Topicus, was kind enough to provide funds to allow the core developers to meet in <a href="http://www.deventer.nl">Deventer</a> and have our international guests stay in a <a href="http://members.home.nl/deleeuw/">nice hotel</a> in the center of town.</p>
<p>It is really nice to finally meet al the guys working on your open source project. Now we can put faces to the messages on the mailinglists.</p>
