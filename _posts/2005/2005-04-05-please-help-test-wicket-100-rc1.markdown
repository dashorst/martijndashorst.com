<p>
Wicket is a new component-oriented web framework distributed under the Apache Open Source license. Wicket takes simplicity, separation of concerns and ease of development to a whole new level. Wicket pages can be mocked up, previewed and later revised using standard WYSIWYG HTML design tools. Dynamic content processing and form handling is all handled in Java code using a first-class component model backed by POJO data beans that can easily be persisted using your favourite technology.</p>
<p>
After months of development, the Wicket team would like to announce the release of Wicket 1.0 Release Candidate 1 (RC1), which is now feature complete and ready for testing and feedback.</p>
<p>
We would especially like to thank the Open Source community for its support and generosity in reaching this important milestone!</p>
<p>
Please have a look.  Help us test Wicket and give us your feedback so we can make the 1.0 final release as good as it can be.</p>
