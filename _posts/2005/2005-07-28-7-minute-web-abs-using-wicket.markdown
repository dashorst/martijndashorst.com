    Ok - I read the scenario.
    I'm thinking about the 7 second workout.
    Cheers, Steve.

<blockquote><b>Hitchhiker</b>: You heard of this thing, the 8-Minute Web Abs?<br />
<b>Ted</b> : Yeah, sure, 8-Minute Web Abs. Yeah, the excercise video.<br />
<b>Hitchhiker</b>: Yeah, this is going to blow that right out of the water. Listen to this: 7... Minute... Web Abs.<br />
<b>Ted</b>: Right. Yes. OK, alright. I see where you're going.<br />
<b>Hitchhiker</b>: Think about it. You walk into a video store, you see 8-Minute Web Abs sittin' there, there's 7-Minute Web Abs right beside it. Which one are you gonna pick, man?<br />
<b>Ted</b>: I would go for the 7.<br />
<b>Hitchhiker</b>: Bingo, man, bingo. 7-Minute Web Abs. And we guarantee just as good a workout as the 8-minute folk.<br />
<b>Ted</b>: You guarantee it? That's -- how do you do that?<br />
<b>Hitchhiker</b>: If you're not happy with the first 7 minutes, we're gonna send you the extra minute free. You see? That's it. That's our motto. That's where we're comin' from. That's from "A" to "B".<br />
<b>Ted</b>: That's right. That's -- that's good. That's good. Unless, of course, somebody comes up with 6-Minute Web Abs. Then you're in trouble, huh? [Hitchhiker convulses]<br />
<b>Hitchhiker</b>: No! No, no, not 6! I said 7. Nobody's comin' up with 6. Who works out in 6 minutes? You won't even get your heart goin, not even a mouse on a wheel.<br />
<b>Ted</b>: That -- good point.<br />
<b>Hitchhiker</b>: 7's the key number here. Think about it. 7-Elevens. 7 doors. 7, man, that's the number. 7 chipmunks twirlin' on a branch, eatin' lots of sunflowers on my uncle's ranch. You know that old children's tale from the sea. It's like you're dreamin' about Gorgonzola cheese when it's clearly Brie time, baby. Step into my office.<br />
<b>Ted</b>: Why?<br />
<b>Hitchhiker</b>: 'Cause you're fuckin' fired!</p></blockquote>
