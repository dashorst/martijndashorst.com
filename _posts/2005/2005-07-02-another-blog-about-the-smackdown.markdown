  content: "I was at the Web Framework Smackdown and thought I'd give you my impressions.
    \ \n\nFirst, I wish this session had come earlier in the conference as I found
    myself wishing I could go back in time and see some of the specific framwework
    presentations.\n\nSecond, while I agree that the consensus of the panel was to
    move away from Struts, the audience didn't seem convinced of that.  Questioner
    after questioner seemed to be begging for someone to tell them why they should
    migrate away from Struts, but no one explicitly did so.\n\nThird, like you I couldn't
    be happier that the Smackdown was nothing like the portal vendor experts panel.
    \ \n\nFinally, I came away without sensing a clear winner of the Smackdown.  It
    seemed pretty clear that Webworks came out on the bottom (although I wonder  if
    the majority of the audience feels that way; there really was a sizable contingent
    who seemed interested in finding the framework that was most like Struts), but
    I couldn't put my finger on the winner.  Wicket and JSF probably came out on top,
    but I could be wrong."

  content: Thanks for your comments. The presentations will be available pretty soon
    I think through Sun. In the mean time, I think you will be helped more by looking
    at the <a href="http://wicket.sf.net/Examples.html">Wicket examples</a> and the
    <a href="http://wicket.sf.net/Introduction.html">Wicket Introduction</a>.

  content: Hi Martjin. I thought the session was pretty useful and brought out some
    key points. But I was hoping for a little more verbal abuse, it was supposed to
    be a smack-down after all. I think Jason scored the most zingers (i.e. "a witty,
    often caustic remark").   Maybe participants should be required to drink 3 irish
    car bombs at the start.

<p>In my quest for more feedback on the Web Framework Smackdown, I've found <a href="http://rollerweblogger.org/page/roller?entry=web_framework_smack_down">this blog entry</a>. I don't agree with the author that it was too nice. In my opinion the idea was to convince people to leave the current MVC or JSP/servlet paradigm behind and create stateful, rich web applications using the component based frameworks of today. And they succeeded more or less.</p>
<p>Having each speaker jack hammering the other's brains out with statements like 'Mine is smaller than yours' (lines of code, that is), or in the case of JSF 'Mine is bigger than yours' (XML files) wouldn't have helped the discussion.</p>
<p>The general sentiment of the panel was: move to component based development or be left behind. Like <a href="http://jroller.com/page/dgeary">David Geary</a> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Struts is old school, get over it"</p></blockquote>
