    Well,
     If you are a seasoned Java developer (meaning you know all of what Java and the Java community has to offer) you will like some of what VS.Net has to offer but mostly will feel like you have your legs and arms tied behind you.  If you stay there long, you will be porting lots of Java stuff to .Net

    Check out Spring.Net. I've used it on at least one .Net project, at least the IOC piece.

    NHibernate to work (correctly).

<p>For my current project, I need to work with MS .NET. The project already uses <a href="http://nhibernate.sourceforge.net/" title="NHibernate">NHibernate</a> and <a href="http://www.nunit.org" title="NUnit">NUnit</a>, both of which I'm familiar with in the Java world.</p>
<p>Although I'm not looking forward to develop mostly in .NET, I anxious to see what .NET does right, and how we can apply that knowlegde for <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a>. Creating a Wicket.NET does't sound that appealing, though. Microsoft already has done a good job at creating a component framework, so probably no need for yet another component framework.</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm already appalled by the installation of the Visual Studio .Net 2003 Architect program. I'm already 2 1/2 hours under way installing the prerequisites (3 times reboot!), security patches (yet another reboot) and installing Visual Studio itself (20% under way)....</p>
