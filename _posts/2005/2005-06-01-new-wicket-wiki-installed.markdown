    Actually, could they revise a few things regarding the wicket website as well?

    Not sure who to contact regarding this, but I've found the 8pt grey fonts on a white background to be almost completely unreadable from my laptop.

    Any chance of some revisions to make this a little easier on the eyes?

<p>Gwynn Evans has installed a <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net/wiki">new wiki</a> for the <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net/">Wicket</a> project. SourceForge forced us to use a wiki with a mysql backend in order to be able to keep on writing stuff to the wiki (that is what it's for). Our selection process was not formal, but we looked at the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiEngines">long list of wiki's</a> out there (if someone complains about the <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net/Introduction.html">number of Java frameworks</a>, point him to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiEngines">this list</a>, by the time he's done reading it, his hair will have turned gray!).</p>
<p>
Our final choice fell on <a href="http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/">MediaWiki</a>, which is the driving force behind the ever powerful <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">WikiPedia</a>. Now the wiki is up and running, we need to make some time to skin it to look more like a Wicket Wiki instead of <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">WikiPedia</a>. However, I think this will be at the end of my long list of stuff to do. If someone wants to volunteer to skin the Wiki to be more like the Wicket website, then please send your skin to me, or create a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=119783&atid=684978">SourceForge feature request</a> and attach your theme.</p>
