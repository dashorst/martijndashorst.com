<p>The <a href="http://www.sf.net" title="Sourceforge">SourceForge</a> statistics are online again and this time they look better than ever. <a href="http://wicket.sf.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a> has almost 4000 downloads in its history. This is more than we expected, as our framework is still very young, and we haven't done much publicity wise (no articles, no online presentations, no books).</p>
<p>The sourceforge statistics are not the complete story however:</p>
<ul>
<li>we also publish our jar files in the maven repository, so people can download and use wicket from maven</li>
<li>CVS downloads are not taken into account</li>
<li>the number of downloads may not reflect the actual number of users: one download per project seems more likely</li>
</ul>
<p>We are very content with these statistics and hope that when we publish our 1.0 final release, that the downloads will rise even further.</p>
