<p>I'm visiting the greek island of Kos the coming week and even though I'm taking my laptop with me, I doubt I will be spending much time working on <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a>. I am confident that we won't have too much trouble with our 1.0 release done last tuesday, as there are <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/detail.php?group_id=119783&ugn=wicket&mode=week&type=prdownload">plenty of people</a> already <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=119783">downloading</a> it.</p>
<p>I hope to return really relaxed and well prepared for my JavaOne 2005 Wicket presentation. I'm taking Wicket 1.0, Tapestry 3.0 and Spring 1.2.1 with me, just in case the weather will turn out to be bad. :-)<br />
