<p>The first ideas for the <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net" title="Wicket">Wicket</a> article are forming in my mind. I am thinking about the current working title:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ease your way into component based web development using Wicket</p></blockquote>
<p>This title seems to address both camps: the current MVC developers looking 'scared' at component based web development, and the developers already proficient in component based web development using either Tapestry or JSF. I intent to show what CBWD is all about, and show that it is not hard to do (when using Wicket). I think that is already a large pickle to grok, so I doubt that comparing the frameworks will fit.</p>
<p>I also have to show these ideas to my editors, and see whether they like the ideas I bring forward here. Comments are as usual appreciated!</p>
