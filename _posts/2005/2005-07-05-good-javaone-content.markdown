<p>As I'm busy creating a presentation for my employer to show that the car bombs were a good investment, I make good use of <a href="http://jroller.com/page/peter_pilgrim/Weblog?catname=%2FJava">Peter Pilgrim's</a> blog, as he made very good notes of all the presentations he attended. I wish he had attended all presentations, so I could 'borrow' his notes for those <em>I</em> attended ;-).</p>
