<p>
Having not overcome my problems with the Wicket maven build, I disabled the junit-report and clover report from the project descriptor, and apparently, Maven 1.1-beta-2 can now build the Wicket project distribution. Enabling these reports and running them from the site plugin just works, so I guess it has something to do with the distribution plugin.</p>
<p>Anyhow.... Expect to be able to download the Wicket 1.1-rc2 within the hour!</p>
