<p>The first beta release of <a href="http://wicket.sf.net/wicket-1.1">Wicket 1.1</a> is only a few hours old and we already have a raving 'review' on the userlist. To quote Matej Knopp:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>1.1.0-b1 is a great release. I've succesfully upgraded my current project. It was almost painless  :)   Actually, it consisting of removing a class that was a wrapper around ListMultipleChoice, because it was obsolete in 1.1, as well as removing my own ChoiceList implementation, since it's no longer required. In general, using 1.1 I could remove some code and the application became simpler and nicer  :)</p>
<p>IChoiceRenderer is great, shorter urls are much nicer too.</p>
<p>I'm going to drop border in favour of markup inheritance.</p>
<p>The overall impression is very positive, thank you for this release.</p>
