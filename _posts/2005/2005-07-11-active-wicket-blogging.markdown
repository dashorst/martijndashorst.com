<p>Some <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net">Wicket</a> users have been very busy blogging about their experiences using <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net">Wicket</a>. <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/geertjan">Geertjan Wielenga</a> is very active in blogging about his experiences combining Wicket and <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">Netbeans</a>. And <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/jsight">Jesse Sightler</a> has published his <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/jsight/20050711#a_wicket_tutorial_i">first tutorial</a> for writing Wicket applications.</p>
<p>I can only encourage such active support from our users! Go Team!</p>
