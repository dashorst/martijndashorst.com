  content: I'd have more sympathy with the SF staff if I didn't know that the default
    response for DB outages over the last couple of months was simply the boiler-plate
    text "SourceForge.net staff are aware of ongoing increases in volume to the project
    MySQL service ..."

<p>Is it too much to take a look at the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?group_id=1&amp;docid=2352">SourceForge Site Status</a> page <em>before</em> you submit a support request with the sourceforge staff? I know that SourceForge has its weaknesses, but flooding the support staff with requests that could be answered easily with a quick glance at the status page show to me that users also have their weaknesses.</p>
<p>
What triggered me to write this item is the current maintenance window for the CVS service of SourceForge.net site. It is currently impossible for developers to commit their work on the CVS services due to a hardware upgrade. They claim it has been scheduled, but probably only in their own agenda's. Now the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=browse&amp;group_id=1&amp;atid=200001">support queue</a> is filling up with messages of users unable to connect to CVS and unwilling to read the Site Status page.</p>
<p>If they had announced this maintenance in a monthly newsletter, that would have saved you, me and themselves some extra work. At least it would have prevented this blog item.</p>
