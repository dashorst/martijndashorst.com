<p>
	The <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a> project announces the<br />
	availability of <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket 1.1-beta 2</a>. This is the second beta release of<br />
	their 1.1 product. The project expects to finalize the 1.1 product in the<br />
	first week of september.</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net">Wicket</a> is a Java web<br />
	application framework that takes simplicity, separation of concerns<br />
	and ease of development to a whole new level. Wicket pages can be<br />
	mocked up, previewed and later revised using standard WYSIWYG HTML<br />
	design tools. Dynamic content processing and form handling is all handled<br />
	in Java code using a first-class component model backed by POJO data<br />
	beans that can easily be persisted using your favourite technology.</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket 1.1-beta 2</a> is a beta release, so you may expect some API changes in<br />
	the coming releases. Most notable features in this release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript support</li>
<li>CSS support</li>
<li>Markup inheritence</li>
<li>Experimental AJAX support</li>
<li>Improved URL handling</li>
<li>Include of external markup</li>
<li>Simplified Choice component</li>

</ul>
<p>
	Please download this release and give us feedback on how you like these new features. A<br />
	final 1.1 release will be available around begin september, so we <em>need your<br />
	feedback!</em></p>
<p><em>Have fun!</em></p>
<p>The Wicket team</p>
