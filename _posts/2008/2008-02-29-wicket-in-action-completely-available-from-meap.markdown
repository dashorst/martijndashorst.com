<p>Finally for all of you that have waited and waited: <a href="http://manning.com/dashorst">Wicket in Action</a> is fully available through the early access program. We are in<br />
production mode, and all the chapters are available from the MEAP. We<br />
hope to have the printed version available somewhere around JavaOne.</p>
<p>You can download all the chapters through the link provided by Manning's announcement. If you haven't bought the book yet, you can order it through the Manning Early Access Program <a href="http://manning.com/dashorst">here</a>.</p>
