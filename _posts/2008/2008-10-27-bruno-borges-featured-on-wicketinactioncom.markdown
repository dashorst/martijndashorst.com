<p>In my new <a href="http://wicketinaction.com/tag/interview">series of interviews</a> with Wicket community members I recently caught up with Bruno Borges, a nice Brazilian guy from Rio de Janeiro. Bruno has been around for quite a while now and if I remember correctly visits the Wicket IRC channel on and off (probably when he isn't lying on Ipanama beach). You can learn more from Bruno and his Wicket adventures in <a href="http://wicketinaction.com/2008/10/meet-the-wicket-community-bruno-borges/">Meet the Wicket Community: Bruno Borges</a>.</p>
