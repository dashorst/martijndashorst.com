It is with great sadness that I must report the staggering loss of my
good friend and colleague, Maurice Marrink. Maurice and his brother
Michel died in a tragic car crash friday August 1st 2008.

<img class="alignnone" src="/uploads/maurice-marrink.jpg" alt="Maurice Marrink" />

Maurice was a dear co-worker, project member and good friend. He was
always enthusiastic, willing to lend a hand and above all friendly.
Coming from the northern parts of the Netherlands, Maurice could be
quite stubborn at times-a trait that is invaluable when working as a
software engineer, especially when working in a group of strong minded
people.

Maurice was a great asset to the Wicket community since Wicket became
open source. The Wicket team was fortunate to have Maurice on board
since last March. He was committed to the continued success of Wicket
and the Apache community as a whole.

Maurice has guided students that created the initial Wicket Dojo
integration (Wicket 1.1 timeframe, before Wicket Ajax). He put a lot of
effort into creating two security frameworks for Wicket, with the
latest and greatest open sourced: the Wicket Security framework (aka
Swarm/Wasp). He had many good ideas on the future of Wicket and
integrating his projects into our core distribution.

Within Topicus he was one of the pillars of our company-professionally,
and even more important: culturally. He was always organizing and
attending social events, nerd nights, cart challenges and board gaming
evenings. Just two weeks ago he was our hero when he arranged tickets
for a pre-screening of Batman: The dark knight at our local IMax
theatre.

Maurice was notorious for his drinking habit: he drank Coca Cola (pure,
no extras) by the gallon. Panic struck when we ran out of it: how can
the world turn without coke? I think that the Coca Cola stock will drop
a bit with the loss of Maurice. Not only his love drinking the Coca
Cola gave him a reputation. When he went on skiing trips, it became an
adventure-without any sign of fear Maurice dove down any piste of any
color (the darker the color the better). He enjoyed performing jumps at
various occasions in half pipes and the occasional bump on the piste-if
there was a chance to get airborne, he took it.

I had a lot of good laughs with Maurice, especially because he was the
inventor of the Not Invented Here syndrome. He has created at least 2
web based security frameworks, and implemented an almost complete
service layer, even when Spring was already the uncontested market
leader in that space.

Maurice was the ultimate software engineer: always improving on what he
has created, endlessly caught in the infinite loop of tweaking,
refactoring, tossing it away and starting all over again. His only
weakness was his love for creating abstractions of abstractions of
abstractions, and making things more generic with each iteration. This
lead to class names such as
`AbstractReusableHibernateDataProviderRegistryHandler` (a made up name,
but you get my drift). You can imagine that this is a problem in
discussions about the internal framework where your tongue and brain
try to combine the 9 concepts in the right sequence.

We've had lots of discussions about our favorite fantasy authors,
recently Terry Goodkind. He had a list of authors I have to read which
I keep forgetting. Writing down stuff was never my strongest point.

I am proud to have worked with Maurice for more than 4 years. It is
rare to meet someone with a similar mind and such a gentle spirit as
Maurice's.

Maurice, I miss you. All my thoughts and good wishes are with you and
your loved ones. May your soul find peace.
