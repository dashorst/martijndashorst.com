  content: I read "My Stroke of Insight" in one sitting - I couldn't put it down.
    I laughed. I cried. It was a fantastic book (I heard it's a NYTimes Bestseller
    and I can see why!), but I also think it will be the start of a new, transformative
    Movement! No one wants to have a stroke as Jill Bolte Taylor did, but her experience
    can teach us all how to live better lives. Her TED.com speech was one of the most
    incredibly moving, stimulating, wonderful videos I've ever seen. Her Oprah Soul
    Series interviews were fascinating. They should make a movie of her life so everyone
    sees it. This is the Real Deal and gives me hope for humanity.

  content: "Thank you for that. Jill Bolte Taylor's My Stroke of Insight is one of
    the most incredible stories I've heard in a long time. Her TEDTalk video blew
    my mind wide open to new possibilities. On the one hand, there's what she went
    through and how she emerged from it. On the other hand, there's what she can teach
    all of us. \r\nI saw the 4 part Oprah interview on Oprah dot com Soul Series and
    I did learn a lot from that, but I'd like to find our more of how to do what Dr.
    Taylor did, without having a stroke of course!\r\nThin how many of us are living
    too much in the head, and not the heart. And of course, you can't get more left
    brain than a Harvard Brain Scientist. Isn't it ironic that she should be the one
    to have the stroke and transform from the quintessential left brainer into this
    \"\"seen the light\"\" disciple of finding inner peace? \r\nI hope this movement
    keeps going. Maybe there will be My Stroke of Insight classes where we can practice
    what Jill Bolte Taylor is preaching."

  content: The New York Times Sunday Newspaper on May 25 had a great two page article
    on Jill Bolte Taylor and her book, "MY STROKE OF INSIGHT". Her book is a must
    read and this NY Times article - called "A Superhighway to bliss" is worth checking
    out too.

  content: "My Stroke of Insight was recommended by our daughter's occupational therapist.\r\nOur
    daughter Kate is 27 years old, her and her husband are new parents of a beautiful
    baby girl and 4 weeks ago Kate had a stroke.  I am now one of her many support
    people she will need to aid in her recovery.  This book has given me insight on
    how to help her.  Thank you Jill."

<p><a title="TED: Ideas worth spreading" href="http://www.ted.com/">Ted talks</a> are really astounding: in less than 20 minutes each talk knows how to captivate you and change your world view. Each talk I've seen so far was remarkable and a true addition to my life's experiences.</p>
<p>But even this highest category of talks has differences in the way a talk grabs you. The talk by Jill Bolte Taylor about <a title="TED | Talks | Jill Bolte Taylor: My stroke of insight (video)" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/229">her stroke of insight</a> was funny, informative and touching in a way you can't imagine. In her talk she explains how the two halves of the human brain work. She even grosses out the audience by displaying a real human brain. This is remarkable in itself, but when she starts talking about her stroke, the talk begins to gain a life of its own.</p>
<p>The way Jill visualizes her experience really struck me. I urge you to see it for yourself, it is one of the most touching talks I have seen. Garr Reynolds from Presentation Zen <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2008/03/dr-jill-bolte-t.html">describes</a> the way how this talk affected him while he watched. It had the same effect on me:</p>
<blockquote><p>"A bit unexpectedly, I was floored. In fact I was moved to tears, as was the packed TED theatre which gave her a huge standing ovation. Take some time today and watch this 18-minute TED presentation. This is such a wonderful talk."</p></blockquote>
<p>So take your 18 minutes and start watching now:</p>
