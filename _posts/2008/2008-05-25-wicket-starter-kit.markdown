    It's still being written (MEAP), but could be a good alternative for people who
    want to get a good background on DI and learn about various implementations (like
    Spring and Guice).

<p>If you read this blog directly on the web you will notice something new in the site structure: links to a <a href="http://martijndashorst.com/blog/shop/">shop</a>. In this shop I have collected several books that complement <a href="http://wicketinaction.com">Wicket in Action</a>.</p>
<p>
	One of the things I've added is the <a href="http://martijndashorst.com/blog/shop/wicket-starter-kit/">Wicket starter kit</a>. This kit contains three books that should be present in your cupboard when developing Wicket applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wicket in Action</li>
<li>Spring in Action</li>
<li>Java Persistence with Hibernate</li>
</ul>
<p>I think these three books provide you with the stack of choice for Java web development: Apache Wicket, Spring and Hibernate. Since not everybody is a starter I've also compiled a couple of lists with books that complement Wicket as a technology. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://martijndashorst.com/blog/shop/ajaxjavascript-books/">JavaScript and Ajax libraries</a></li>
<li><a href="http://martijndashorst.com/blog/shop/databaseormenterprise/">Database, ORM and enterprise technologies</a></li>
<li><a href="http://martijndashorst.com/blog/shop/testing/">Testing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy these books!</p>
