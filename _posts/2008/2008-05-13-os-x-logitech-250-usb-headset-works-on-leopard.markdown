  content: I guess this means Leopard is better at detecting your cautiousness when
    attaching the headset, and as a result decides no to freeze ;-)

<p>In a <a href="http://martijndashorst.com/blog/2007/12/18/logitech-os-xs-achilles-heel/">previous post</a>, which happens to be high on Google's search results when looking for OS X drivers and Logitech products, I lamented Logitech's driver support for not working and mostly keeping quiet about it.</p>
<p>I've recently upgraded my MacBook Pro to Leopard and it seems that the freezing problem has been fixed. I haven't encountered the spinning beach ball of death due to connecting my Logitech headset. But I must confess that I am very cautious currently when attaching the headset, and haven't used it for a while. I'm slightly optimistic that this problem is solved.</p>
