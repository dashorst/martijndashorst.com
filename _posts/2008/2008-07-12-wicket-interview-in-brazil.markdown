  content: Hi, I read the magazine interview. For me, it´s very usefull, mainly because
    I could view the road of wicket is going on. I´d love the wicket away of making
    web applications. Again, that´s great work !!!

<p>A couple of months ago Eelco and I were interviewed by Bruno Pereira for a Brazilian Java magazine. Unfortunately for us this interview was done through email, so no carnival for us. Maybe next year :). You can read the <a href="http://brunopereira.org/2008/07/06/interview-with-eelco-hillenious-and-martijn-dashorst-from-apache-wicket/">interview here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was a Windows client developer used to build GUI's with Borland's VCL. Then I had to build web apps using Maverick and Velocity. I hated that experience and constantly asked myself: WHY is this so hard and so much work. Wicket salvaged me from this negative experience: it felt like returning to VCL programming and for the first time I enjoyed<br />
building web apps.</p></blockquote>
