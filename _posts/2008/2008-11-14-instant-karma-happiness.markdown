<p>Sometimes when you feel down and let down by humanity you need to find something to cheer you up. For some reason seeing that the whole world can be united with a simple stupid dance does that for me. <a href="http://www.wherethehellismatt.com">"Where the hell is Matt"</a> (site currently down) is a long running internet fad that still inspires a lot of people around the world. Forget about all the stuff that is wrong in your life for just a couple of minutes and see that all is not that bad:</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zlfKdbWwruY&hl=en&fs=1&ap=%2526fmt%3D22"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zlfKdbWwruY&hl=en&fs=1&ap=%2526fmt%3D22" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>
<p>Of course, one might argue that one guy flying around the globe giving a bad dance performance at each location is exactly what is wrong with this world. However, I'm giving this guy the benefit of the doubt: seeing all those people flocking to dance with him and be part of a global culture is a positive energy in our universe. Instant karma happiness.</p>
