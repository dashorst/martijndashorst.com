<p>The open source GIS server project called <a href="http://geoserver.org">GeoServer</a> has chosen <a href="http://wicket.apache.org">Apache Wicket</a> for their web interface. I've been following their progress through the Nabble archives from a distance and saw them reach a formidable milestone today. David Winslow <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Using-coverage-data-tp19059252p19059252.html">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey all, I have reached my goal of &gt;40%  test coverage for all wicket  modules (hooray!).</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a great achievement and I hope for a bright future for the Wicket and GeoServer combination!</p>
