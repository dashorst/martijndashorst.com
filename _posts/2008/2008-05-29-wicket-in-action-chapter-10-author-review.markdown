  content: Seriously, this is one of the best technology books I've ever read.  I
    wish I'd had it when I started using Wicket.  Every chapter has taught me something
    nevertheless.  Looking forward to the final copy.  Greetings from Texas.

<p>I'm just starting to review the edits our copy editor has performed for chapter 10 of <a href="http://wicketinaction.com">Wicket in Action</a>. This is quite some work, and I sit in my garden with some music, birds chirping, and an agreeable 66F (19C) temperature.	In front of me: 26 pages of edits and comments waiting to be reviewed.</p>
