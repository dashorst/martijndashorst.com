  content: 'Man, your country has one of the best team I ever saw. The second and
    third goals are just marvelous ! I enjoyed every minute of this match (I just
    was able to saw the second half), and it was a great pleasure : the best team
    has won ! I don''t even feel seed for my team, as they had some opportunity, as
    it contributed to make this match really pleasant. France has a team under heavy
    refactoring : it''s not easy to replace someone like Zidane !'

  content: I didn't see the game, because I am in the US now, but I saw the game against
    Italy, and it was GREAT.  Phenomenol.  They took Italy apart.  The French team
    is a good one, but their defense is too old and slow.  All their 20 year olds
    (Benzema, Nasri, Gomis) are attackers and not in the game anyway.  Youth wins
    the day again.

    if the final match triumphs in orange just like the Wicket css file. :-)

  content: "Revenge in the semi final???\r\n\r\nI don't say that it is impossible
    that the Dutch will meet France again, but in order to let that happen:\r\n1)
    The Dutch must defeat Romania (difficult)\r\n2) France must beat Italy (very difficult)\r\n3)
    The Dutch must win the quarter final (difficult, but possible)\r\n4) France must
    win the quarter final (difficult)\r\n\r\nMmmm.....we'll get back to you on this
    one, when we have seen more matches ;-).\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,\r\n\r\nSteven"

    on official matches. And keep a good spirit.\r\n\r\nBut after this defeat french
    think this is no longer possible to do anything. Melancholia..."

    good as they did against France and Italy), but I am affraid step two did not
    go as you hoped for.\r\n\r\nWhat can I say, let's hope you guys will find a better
    coach, who will bring in fresh blood into the team ;-).\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,\r\n\r\nSteven"

<p>Even though I'm not a very big football fan (soccer for you Yanks :)), I do enjoy a good football match. This night's soccer match between the Netherlands and France was a great match with good football coming from both sides. The french did put up a good fight but weren't as fortunate as the Dutchies. Anyway, getting kicked in the ball by us dutchies must feel like punishment. 4-1 and 3-0 to the number 1 and 2 of the WORLD. That must count for something.</p>
<p>	Anyway thanks to France for a great match. Fortune has mistreated you. Kudos to the dutch guys as well. You've been marvelous.</p>
