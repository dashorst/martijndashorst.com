<p>One of the reasons why I haven&#x27;t been very fast with releasing Wicket 1.4-m3 is because some dear friends from Hungary are over at our place celebrating a week of vacation in a drowning Holland.</p>
<p>
	My friend Jen&#x151; has promised me that he&#x27;ll convert his company to use Wicket when a lot of people read the <a href="http://jenoe.blogspot.com">comics on his blog</a>. The comics, drawn by his children Gerle and Vir&aacute;g, were originally written in Hungarian, which is difficult to master (I know, having tried to learn it myself), so we translated several of them.</p>
<p>
	So help out the Wicket community by reading the comics of <a href="http://jenoe.blogspot.com" title="Itt laknak BuborÃ©k.">Gerle, Vir&aacute;g &eacute;s Jen&#x151;</a>.</p>
