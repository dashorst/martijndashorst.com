Developer.com has picked the product of 2008 and Apache Wicket was <a href="http://www.developer.com/db/article.php/10920_3721761_2" title="Winners of the Developer.com's Product of the Year 2008 Are Announced">one of finalists</a> in the category Open Source product.</p>
<p>
It is very encouraging to see Wicket in the same list as Netbeans, Java 6, JBoss Application Server and Subversion. Interesting tidbit: 4 of the 5 finalists were Java products. Therefore I declare: Java is dead, Long live Java!</p>
