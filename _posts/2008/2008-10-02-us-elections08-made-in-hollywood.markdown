  content: "I am glad your understanding of Wicket is better than your understanding
    of American Politics.  Love the book by the way.\r\n\r\nMcCain picked Palin because
    he wanted somebody who was not a Washington insider.  A mirror image of Biden.
    \ He also needed somebody who would help get the American Conservative vote.  McCain
    was not the American Conservative favorite and many were willing to walk out on
    this election.  Let the Socialist Obama along with a Socialist Congress really
    screw things up and then have somebody like a Reagan come up in 4 to 8 years and
    be about real \"Change\".\r\n\r\nBut, then Palin is picked and it energizes the
    Conservative Base.  So, the only thing the Main Stream Media can do is put her
    in skits and cut up hours long interviews into 6 minutes segments to make her
    look bad.\r\nImagine if people took a word here and word there out of your book.
    \ They could quote you anyway they wanted to.\r\n\r\nLet see, she is Pro Gun,
    Pro Life, Small Government, and willing to take on corruption in her own party.
    \ All pluses for a lot of people in America who are a silent majority.  \r\n\r\n-Gary"

  content: A lot of people (in the US, but also in Holland) like to vote for people
    they can imagine themselves drinking a beer with. Personally, I rather see someone
    elected who is incredibly sharp and has a good strategical understand of how the
    world works. I'm such an elitist ;-)

  content: "@Gary\r\n\r\n[rant]\r\nYou'd be surprised at how in-depth American politics
    are covered in Holland, and how much the Dutch love to discuss politics.\r\n\r\nBut
    frankly, if you look at things objectively, it should come as no surprise that
    most Europeans favor Democrats. After all, they were raised with the idea that
    there should be a balance between financial freedom and sharing, so that people
    not only have the money, but also the time, stability and security etc to raise
    their families and go after their dreams. Many view the cut-taxes mantra of the
    Republicans, as unwillingness of the rich to share a piece of the pie. Europeans
    are trying to find a balance between the economic philosophies out there, and
    consider themselves being pragmatist rather than either socialist or capitalist,
    and many think that Republican ideals are just too fundamentalist. And besides
    that, Democrats are traditionally in favor of international cooperation, whereas
    Republicans, certainly during the last eight years, have been arrogant bullies
    in world politics, even towards their own allies.\r\n\r\nNow about these elections...
    I consider myself being an independent. I like fairness and sharing and all, but
    I also like policies that work and that don't make people apathetic (Jonathan
    Locke, the philosopher, not the coder, wrote some great thoughts on that when
    he compared French democracy with American democracy). And in many cases, I think
    small government works better than big government.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I'm not
    crazy about European labour protection. In Holland, it is common to hire people
    fresh out of school for the long term, and if you're over 35 and want to change
    a career, you're out of luck - too expensive too invest in, too much of a risk
    in case things don't work out. I feel America is a lot fairer because it is easier
    to hire and fire, which keeps the markets way more flexible.\r\n\r\nAnother example
    is that - at least in Seattle - there aren't as many rules against having live
    music. As a result, there is a thriving music scene here, and I can see live music
    in a number of places any day of the week. Amsterdam feels dead and uninspired
    by comparison.\r\n\r\nYet another example is that driving through Seattle looks
    great, because all the houses look different. Dutch old towns are charming, but
    outside the cores, it's cookie cutter galore. And try to rent a home or apartment
    in Holland... you either have to earn plenty to afford the private sector, or
    be willing to stay on a list for years (yes I said years) before something comes
    up.\r\n\r\nSo, I could definitively support an agenda with conservative elements
    (for any Dutch reading this, I used to vote for D66, who have been disappointing
    in power, but represent my political ideals pretty well). However, just based
    on the mediocre candidates that the Republicans keep putting forward, their tactics
    of winning by FUD, the fact that voting Republican equals voting for a fundamentalist
    Christian agenda, the fact that for all their gung-ho rhetoric about small government
    and not raising taxes, time after time when they are in power they increase US
    national debt to record heights, their history of trampling the constitution (with
    recent example like GTMO and the expansion abilities of government when it comes
    to spying on its citizens), makes that even though I believe in some of the conservative
    principals, there isn't a hair on my head who'd think about voting Republican.
    Unfortunately, there are just two parties to realistically choose from.\r\n\r\nIf
    I were allowed to vote (which I'm not unfortunately; I'll have to wait a few years
    for that), I would vote for Obama. Lets get back to using diplomacy as the main
    tool in achieving America's international goals and work on its international
    standing. Lets think big and be a leader in green energy - see it as a huge opportunity
    instead of critique on the American way of life. Etc. I just hope they won't go
    overboard with regulating :-)\r\n[/rant]"

I think the script writers in Hollywood are taking notes, because this year's election in the US are just incredible. It feels like a horror movie made by Sam Raimi (I love his Evil Dead trilogy!) where humor, slapstick and horror mash into a brilliant movie.</p>
<p>
As an outsider I can't believe what the GOP (Republican Party) was thinking when they picked Sarah Palin as the running mate to McCain. Sure she's better looking than Mrs Clinton (who never got into a final for a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0OZ9W2K_z0" title="YouTube - Sarah Palin Pageant - The Talent Competition">beauty pageant</a> I think), but those are not assets you'd want near the Oval office (even Bill Clinton has experienced that).</p>
<p>
Every interview with Mrs Palin I've seen on youtube and TV (yes the US elections are a hot topic in the Netherlands as well), can be taken straight out of Monty Python's Flying Circus. In fact, Saturday Night Live actually used a transcript of a Sarah Palin interview in one of their sketches (Tina Fey does a perfect <a href="http://www.comedycentric.com/2008/09/14/tina-fey-and-amy-poehler-address-the-snl-nation-transcript/" title="Tina Fey and Amy Poehler Address the &#8216;SNL&#8217; Nation - Transcript">portrayal of Mrs Palin</a> IMO)</p>
<p>
Like <a href="http://tinyurl.com/534w85" title="YouTube - Diddy Blog #24 - Sarah Palin Scares Me">P. Diddy</a>, I'm scared that this <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1868008" title=""Talking Points" Caribou Barbie? on Vimeo">Caribou Barbie</a> will be one breath away from becoming the most powerful leader on this planet. Especially in these times with 2 wars, a huge economic crisis, a gargantuan debt, aging, troubles with Iran, Syria, North Korea, Russia, Venezuela, etc. These are not the types of issues that a beauty queen has to answer questions about.</p>
<p>
Here's a thought: maybe John McCain really doesn't want to win the election, but wants to ensure that Obama will be the next president. That would mean that McCain puts an enormous trust in the intelligence of the citizens of the USA. As he's a proud patriotic citizen I can imagine having such a profound trust in your People. There's just one caveat: these are the same people that voted Bush Jr. into the oval office twice in a row.</p>
<p>
