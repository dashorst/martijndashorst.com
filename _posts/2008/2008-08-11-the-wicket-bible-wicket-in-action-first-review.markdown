	The first Wicket in Action review is in. Geertjan Wielenga <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/geertjan/entry/wicket_in_action_undoubtedly_the">writes:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>[I]f you're new to Wicket look no further. "Wicket in Action" provides everything you need. In particular for beginners, chapter [3] ("Building a cheesy Wicket application") is excellent: it shows you step by step how to create a pretty advanced Wicket application... and covers 30 pages. That's pretty impressive and it's a very thorough introduction to what Wicket offers you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you Geertjan for your kind words! They made my day!</p>
