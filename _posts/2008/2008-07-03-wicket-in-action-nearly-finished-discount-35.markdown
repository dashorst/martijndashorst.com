<p>Eelco and I are working our asses off to get <a href="http://wicketinaction.com">Wicket in Action</a> done. We have been saying this for the last two years, but we're actually in the final stages of publishing: our last 2 chapters are back for author review and I've read chapters 1-10 we got back from our formatter so we could look at the final result for the first time. The end is getting closer!</p>
<p>
To celebrate chapters 1 through 10, and the author reviews of chapters 13 and 14 I'll let you in on a little secret: you can get a 35% discount for Wicket in Action (and more in Action books) in the <a href="http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001u-j_otdQw6BsOpwnjkpzmkNAThV6FM-rLqtzPJj73oHGJ1l6V0FXVVzce6cuQZbdTF5OBuT46p42FwYLWaycupx4q5gyviwjD1tMcuWrxcEwWNOYxll5BqOJ3nDzIB4D">Manning shop</a> by using the coupon <strong>JY125</strong> at checkout. This offer expires July 8, 2008 ($20 minimum purchase).</p>
