<p>The title says it <a href="http://herebebeasties.com">Al</a>: Google hosts the next <a href="http://www.jweekend.com/dev/LWUGReg/">London Wicket event</a>. There is a <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Google-to-host-the-London-Wicket-Event-...-tp14653945p14653945.html">hint of sandwiches</a>.</p>
<p>
In other news: new chapters have come available through the <a href="http://manning.com/dashorst" title="Wicket in Action">Wicket in Action</a> early access program: chapters 9 and 10. Unfortunately later than <a href="/blog/2007/12/13/wicket-in-action-meap-chapters-9-and-10/">expected</a>, <strike>and I'm sorry you weren't able to sneak away with these new chapters from the in-laws during the festive days</strike>. Fortunately you were able to spend quality time with your family during these festive days instead of sitting behind the laptop trying new examples from Wicket in Action.</p>
