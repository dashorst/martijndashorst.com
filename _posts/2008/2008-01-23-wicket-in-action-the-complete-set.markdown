  content: Congratulations! Can't wait for the last chapters. The reading has so far
    been all pleasant, even if I admit falling asleep during one chapter. But that
    wasn't the books fault... :-)

<p>Rejoice! For I have some great news to share...</p>
<p><a href="http://manning.com/dashorst">Wicket in Action</a>'s final chapter has been submitted for editorial review. Eelco has sacrificed his health (stay well my friend!) and worked until 2am to finalize this last chapter.</p>
<p>Bringing the creative parts to completion is like dropping a millstone we have carried around for roughly 2 years. Being relieved of that nagging feeling that you don't have to finish those 11, 10, 7, 4 and 2 final chapters is really a liberation. Not having to say that you <em>must</em> write, but are able to just 'wing it' for a night is such a relief, you can't imagine... </p>
<p>Note that this doesn't mean that the final MEAP chapters will come quickly. The publisher does like to let them trickle in over the course of a couple of months until we are chopping trees.</p>
