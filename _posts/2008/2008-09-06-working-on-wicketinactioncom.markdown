  content: "Martijn, why is it that the index page source shows :\r\n\r\n&lt;div id=\"bd\"&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div
    id=\"yui-main\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;wicket:link&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;img src=\"front.png\"
    title=\"Wicket in Action\" ..\r\n\r\nMore precisely, it's the wicket:link tag
    :-O\r\nIt would be great if the W.I.A. site was running on top of Wicket !\r\n(But
    I guess that it slipped through a copy/paste)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJawher."

  content: The wicket stuff extenstions should be offering nice additional features
    for wicket frameworks users,but I have found these extensions to be full of crap...mismodificatons...buggy
    software...they do not bring any new add-ons to the table..only annoying buggy
    software that shoud be left RIP-state...Rest-In-Peace buggy software graveyard....

<p>I'm currently working on the official support site for our book <a href="http://wicketinaction.com">wicketinaction.com</a>. This website will become the new home for my Wicket related blogging, freeing this blog for more personal related stuff (like new cats, beer bellies, rants on other open source projects, etc.).</p>
<p>
	The website is already running, but I'm working on a Wordpress based website, to enable blogging, and multiple author writing (provided that someone else is interested in writing content there). So what you currently see will be replaced with a (in my opinion) better looking site, with more options for dynamic content.</p>
<p>
	So if you want to take a look before the site is changed, go look <a href="http://wicketinaction.com">now</a>!</p>
