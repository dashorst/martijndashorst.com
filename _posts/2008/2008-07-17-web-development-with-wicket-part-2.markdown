<p>One of my favorite blog authors gives us the second installment of his award winning series of Wicket articles (I have your awards right here, Nathan!): <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-07-2008/jw-07-wicket2.html" title="Web development with Wicket, Part 2: Reducing and re-using code - Java World">Reducing and re-using code</a>. This time Nathan discusses Wicket's abilities to create reusable components using panels, markup inheritance. In the article he creates an extravaganza of calculators on a single page. Geeky yet somehow comforting.</p>
<p>
	In case you missed it, the first installment was an <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-06-2008/jw-06-wicket1.html" title="Web development with Wicket, Part 1: The state of Wicket - Java World">introduction to the Wicket framework</a>, which is also a very good read.</p>
