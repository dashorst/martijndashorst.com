  content: "Congratulations Martijn! I was suffering through the writing right alongside
    you (Seam in Action), so I can appreciate the feeling you had when you received
    that box. I could hardly believe my eyes when I received mine.\r\n\r\nOnly one
    problem. Where is Seam in Action in that stack of Manning books? I'll get yours
    if you get mine ;)"

<p>
In the true tradition of photo documenting the <em>unboxing</em> of fabulous products that arrive in boxes, I took lots of pictures during the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dashorst/tags/unboxing/">unboxing event</a> of the very first <a href="http://wicketinaction.com">Wicket in Action</a> delivery.</p>
<p>
I tried to build up the tension with photographing the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dashorst/2819061304/">outside</a> of the box, ensuring <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dashorst/2818214719/">good depth of field</a>, and then <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dashorst/2818214399/">opening up</a> the box, showing <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dashorst/2818214281/">barely a glimpse of the contents</a>. And I finished with a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dashorst/2818213007/">couple</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dashorst/2818212679/">of</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dashorst/2818212899/">alternative</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dashorst/2819059084/">uses</a> for when you are <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dashorst/2818212209/">done reading</a>.</p>

If you have ordered your copy and not yet received it, be patient&mdash;getting the prints of a book first is a writer's prerogative.</p>
