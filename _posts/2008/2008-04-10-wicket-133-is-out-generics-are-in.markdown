<p>We just released <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/wicket/1.3.3">Wicket 1.3.3</a> and moved the 1.3 codebase into its own branch to make room for new development.</p>
<p>Johan committed the first go at a generified, Java 5 based Wicket framework during the Wicket Amsterdam Meetup held last tuesday. The meetup was great, and I have video of all the talks. Now I just need to ensure the video is good quality and have to transcode it into a web format. I'll keep you posted on the progress.</p>
<p>So if you depend on Wicket 1.3 and want to build your own Wicket, you should switch your repository to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/wicket/branches/wicket-1.3.x">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/wicket/branches/wicket-1.3.x</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in an adventure and dare to move to Java 5 based Wicket you can check out trunk:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/wicket/trunk">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/wicket/trunk</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that trunk will be in flux during the next couple of weeks while we iron out the wrinkles of moving to Java 5</p>
