  content: "Yes, but only for published books (Wicket in Action is still in production).
    Apparently you can't order the dead tree only version through the Manning site
    for non-published bookes. So you'll have to either opt for the combo or the e-book
    version for books that are in MEAP. Some books however are already published and
    the discount is also available for them.\r\n\r\nIt only applies to the whole order
    (you might want to order each book separately then)"
