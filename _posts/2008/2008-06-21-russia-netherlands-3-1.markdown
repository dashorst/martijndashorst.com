<p>In a disappointing match between Russia and the Netherlands, the Russians defeated the dutch on all fronts. The Dutch coach of Russia, Guus Hiddink, outclassed Marco van Basten on a strategic level and ensured that the star team from Holland never got to play the game we all came to love (except for the Italians and French). The Russians were better on all fronts and their victory was deserved. The #10 of the Russians was rightfully chosen as the player of the match, and I think Edwin van der Sar was the best dutch guy. Anyway, I'm hoping for a Germany-Russia final where Russia wins. Then we still have a slight orange glow over this championship.</p>
