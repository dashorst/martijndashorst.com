<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Wicket-Experts-Voice-Java/dp/1590597222" title="Amazon.com: Pro Wicket (Expert's Voice in Java): Books: Karthik Gurumurthy">Pro Wicket</a> author Karthik Gurumurthy speaks about "Wicket, Tapestry and JSF side by side" in <a href="http://www.indicthreads.com/videos/1158/jsf__tapestry_ajax_wicket_java.html" title="Wicket, Tapestry and JSF side by side : Video - Enterprise Java Software Developer Station">this video</a> recorded at the Indian  IndicThreads conference. </p>
<p>I haven't watched the whole video, so I will let you be the judge on that. The video is rather low quality and the audio is not too good: it seems like it was not recorded from a microphone in the direct vicinity of Karthik but from somewhere in the audience.</p>
