<p>My new website for all stuff related to Wicket is getting some traction: the number of visitors is rising, though not at the same level this one has. The goal of <a href="http://wicketinaction.com/" title="Wicket in Action">wicketinaction.com</a> is to become an official place for Wicket Community related news, not just book news. Expect release announcements, events announcements and articles to be published on wicketinaction.com</p>
<p>
I suspect the new <a href="http://wicketinaction.com/" title="Wicket in Action">wicketinaction.com</a> website will become more popular now that <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/ivaynberg" title="Igor Vaynberg - LinkedIn">Igor Vaynberg</a>, one of the most prominent committers for the Wicket project, has pledged to start blogging on <a href="http://wicketinaction.com/" title="Wicket in Action">wicketinaction.com</a>.</p>
<p>
I'm expecting quite some dynamite from mr. Vaynberg&mdash;he's responsible for the awesome <a href="http://wicketstuff.org/wicket13/repeater" title="Wicket Examples - repeater views">repeaters package</a>, <a href="http://wicketstuff.org/wicket13/spring" title="Wicket/Spring Integration Examples">spring integration</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/salve/" title="salve - Google Code">salve</a> (Salve solves the problems that cause anemic domain model anti-pattern and brings back object oriented programming to the business tier).</p>
