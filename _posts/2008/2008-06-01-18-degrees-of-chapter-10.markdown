<p>And it is nice weather outside again. It is past 11pm and still 18 degrees Celsius (65F). With the heating of my MacBook Pro, a good fleece sweater and the wonderful voice of Joss Stone (Live Session EP, iTunes exclusive) it is very comfortable outside.</p>
<p>	I'm hoping to finish the review of <a href="http://wicketinaction.com">Wicket in Action</a>'s chapter 10 tonight. The chapter covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Ajax components and behaviors to create responsive web UIs</li>
<li>Contribute JavaScript and CSS to the <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt> section with header contributors</li>
<li>Integrate third party JavaScript libraries in your custom components</li>
<li>Gotcha?s when using Ajax in your applications</li>
</ul>
<p>	I'll have to take a picture of this setup someday. Though I can't say I enjoy writing, working on a cool night outside certainly is high on my favorite things to do. Now, if I can only come up with a way to include beer in this equation...</p>
