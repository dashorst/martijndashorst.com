  content: "Martijn, \r\n\r\nWhat's worse is that sometimes the line number is totally
    impossible to trace because it's not from an included file, but rather refers
    to the line number in the constructed HTML file that is rendered, complete with
    included JS, as with a finished Wicket page. It's incredibly frustrating.\r\n\r\nBut
    do not abandon hope. The answer to your problems is the Microsoft Script Debugger.
    If you have JS debugging turned on and can induce the error, the SD will pop up
    with the file that caused the problem and the line that caused the problem is
    highlighted; exactly what you need to debug the problem. \r\n\r\nInstructions
    for debugging and installing can be found <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2004/10/26/247912.aspx\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">on the MS IE blog</a>. As with most IE developer solutions (like
    the invaluable IE developer toolbar), it's not the most stable piece of software
    in the world, and you may find yourself having to restart IE multiple times on
    occasion in order to get the script debugger to show up properly when there's
    an error.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that's stupid about it is that when script debugging
    is turned on, the little exclamation icon in the status bar <em>does not show
    up anymore</em>. Dumb, dumb dumb. It's imperfect, but better than the utterly
    useless error message in the standard IE installation.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."

    and re-opens my closed pages, it's intuitive, simple, efficient, and works with
    my windows XP Prof. just fine. Hell, it worked just fine with my Windows 98!\r\n\r\nInternet
    Explorer is painfully slow, does not start when I want it to, it's new interface
    (IE&amp;) sucks as it's hard to know what does what on its crappy interface. I
    only use it when a website calls for it, and I hate the websites that call for
    it, as well. They need to get with the program, and stop gearing their sites on
    this bloated crappy Internet Explorer."

    Explorer really sucks !!!  When people log onto Internet Explorer they will get
    the problems ( trogens, viruses, error messages etc. ) people should go to other
    web browsers and make the switch like I did. I switched to Mozilla Firefox about
    late 2006 and I am really happy with my switch.  Another thing I did was switch
    to OpenOfficeOrg.3 this software is the better allturnative to Microsoft Office
    it's better looking and I also switched over to Goggle Chrome.  Microsoft should
    make better software.  Microsoft is the worlds biggest software company why is
    that they want you to buy more and more of their software when their software
    malfunctions Microsoft's Web Browser is in my opinion is CRAP !!!!

    layout works like a charm in FF and is total crap in IE.\r\n\r\nI really I hope
    in the near future chrome or firefox would take the lead and become the dominant
    browser but I guess that's just wishful thinking."

  content: Javascript is an interpreted language, and like most interpretative languages
    it gives a ton of freedom. Especially in its concepts of types. Meaning (coming
    from a structured programming background C,C++) etc it almost lets you get away
    with murder.. A variable as var i=1 and then i="hello there" is allowed (changing
    from integers to strings) etc.. Where IE fails miserable is it tries to force
    structured programing strictness in an almost free for all programming environment.
    The biggest problems Ive seen are this free for all type assignment. For example
    any mozilla based browser lets you freely give any value to any object that you
    want. As in object.style.height=adjkasdjsak; Whereas IE in a double standard says
    that an interpretative language has to perform like a structured language but
    only when its convenient for IE. For example setting the DOM style properties
    on any object as height to some bogus value causes IE to fail whereas mozilla
    ignores it. Using reserved words as "value" etc or any word that IE determines
    is a reserved property causes IE to punt. As var value=1 (fails in IE because
    value is a reserved word). Most conflicts in IE programming vs Mozilla seem to
    rest in IE¬¥s desire to force C style rules in javascript.

  content: "Okay guys, just one thing. Stop using hacks for IE. When it‚Äôs ugly in
    IE (but still working when it is not too much trouble), leave it that way so users
    of your sites can see the difference between browsers. Place a note on your website
    that it will looking better in other browsers like firefox, chrome or safari so
    they cannot blame you. Let your users know there are alternatives (not only the
    blue e that is associated with internet). Users must see the difference, don‚Äôt
    use hacks to get the same look, that‚Äôs stupid and that‚Äôs the fault. They don‚Äôt
    see your pain to get it compatible with this horrible piece of shit. Don‚Äôt use
    images when you can do it with CSS, that‚Äôs the difference between browsers.\r\n\r\nDevelopers
    can break IE if they want but every developer on the planet must do this. When
    we do it all together and the user of the website can see the difference, there
    is an reason to switch. When user cannot see the difference there is no reason
    for them to switch!\r\n\r\nStop IE hacks and inform your clients about alternatives,
    it‚Äôs free and not bad,almost it‚Äôs better. When every developer do this it can
    change the world of browsing. Site visitors must not blame you about the looks,
    the must blame Microsoft but they have to be informed that there are alternatives
    to use and that is really better and matters.\r\n\r\nStop IE Hacks now!"

  content: I hate IE and I can't stand Microsoft either. I think that they should
    pass a law in North America where we don't have to have IE as a browser on our
    computers when we buy a new one with Windows OS. I've created websites and they
    look really crappy in IE, but, just fine in FF, Google Chrome, Safari and a lot
    of other browsers. Heard the developers at Google are coming up with an OS. Good
    for them. It's about time those arrogant people at Microsoft are shown that their
    operating system is a joke. Look at Vista for example. Bill Gates is a joke too.
    I predict the end of Microsoft. People will start to say Microsoft? Who's that?

<p>Debugging JavaScript is always a problem, but even more so in IE. Things should be better in IE8 but today my focus was on IE6. The tip of the day is: when IE shows an error during loading, it will provide you with a line number. You can look for hours at the line number and not figure out what it means and where the error happened.</p>
<p>I found out after much puzzling that IE will show the line number where the error happened from the file. So if you load foo.js and an exception occurs on line 731, IE will tell you only the line number. You have to find out for yourself which file is the cause. Oh, and you should subtract 1 from the line number.</p>
<p>Why is it impossible for IE engineers to provide helpful error messages? Is it so hard to actually show the filename as well?</p>
