<p>The Wicket community has grown quite a bit since Wicket's inception. The core Wicket team is pretty visible through the various blogs and meetups?but the community is more! Meet your fellow Wicketeers and read all about them.</p>
<p>Our first victim is one of Wicket's most visible supporters: Nino Martinez Wael. Read more about Nino and his <a href="http://wicketinaction.com/2008/10/meet-the-wicket-community-nino-martinez-wael/">experiences with Wicket here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a couple of follow up questions for Nino, please leave a comment on the blog. I'm sure Nino will be quick to answer them :)</p>
<p>I've got a couple more interviews in the basket, so expect more in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>Thank you Nino for being so kind to participate in this interview!</p>
