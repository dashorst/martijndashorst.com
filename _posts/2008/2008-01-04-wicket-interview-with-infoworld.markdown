  content: "Congratulations for the interview, and also for the final release of wicket...\r\n\r\nI'm
    using wicket for some months here in brazil and i'm really happy with it. \r\n\r\nI
    love the wicket simplicity and elegance, never found this on any other java framework
    before...\r\n\r\nI've built a job board app using Wicket which is called openjobs,
    it was a great fun learning wicket and building this web app...\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nEduardo

With the release of Wicket 1.3 Paul Krill (Editor at Large of InfoWorld) wanted to interview a spokesperson for the Wicket framework. I performed one of my duties as the Chair of the project: I answered the questions as good as I could and hoped for the best. Always watch your words when you talk to a reporter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Developing Web applications in Java has been a problem; Apache looks to address this with Wicket, according to Dashorst. "In JSF (JavaServer Faces), for instance, it's fairly hard to create your custom components. You need to have almost a graduate degree to create custom components with JSF," he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Paul Krill asked if he could speak with a Wicket user, so I recommended <a href="http://www.systemmobile.com/wp/" title="">Nick Heudecker</a> and <a href="http://www.antwerkz.com/wp/" title="Antwerkz, Inc.">Justin Lee</a> to him. Ultimately he talked only to Nick:</p>
<blockquote><p>"With Wicket, it's just a lot easier. There's no extraneous configuration. Everything is controlled within the Java code. Once people have an opportunity to take a look at it, they'll really like it.â€</p></blockquote>
