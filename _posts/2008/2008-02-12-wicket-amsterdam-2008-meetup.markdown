<p>It is meetup time again! Our previous Amsterdam Meetup was a big success<br />
and we want to continue that tradition. Over 80 Wicket developers<br />
attended the previous meetup and we had a blast. If you have missed<br />
the previous meetup from Nov 30th, 2007 you can see the <a title="Flickr: Photos tagged with wicketmeetup" href="http://flickr.com/tags/wicketmeetup">pictures</a>, or enjoy the <a title="SlideShare Â» Slideshows tagged with wicket (share powerpoint presentations online, slideshows, slide shows, download presentations, widgets, MySpace codes)" href="http://www.slideshare.net/tag/wicket">presentations</a>.</p>
