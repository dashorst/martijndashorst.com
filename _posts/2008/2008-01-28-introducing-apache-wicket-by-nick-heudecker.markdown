  content: "I followed for a long time the Apache Cocoon project.\r\nDeveloping Forms
    became a nightmare with Flowscript and all the Transformers an Generators.\r\nCocoon
    3 started the cooperation with Wicket.\r\nFrustrated by the integration of Dojo
    I examined Wicket and I was surprised how easy \r\nForm development could be and
    how adaptable it is.\r\nAfter 2 weeks of experience I read your article, and found
    my way would have been less sony when I had encountered it at the beginning."

<p>Nick Heudecker, a long time Wicket fan, has written an introductory article about <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=48234" title="Article: Introducing Apache Wicket">Wicket for TheServerSide</a>. I had the pleasure to read it in advance and I liked it. You should <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/tt/articles/article.tss?l=IntroducingApacheWicket" title="Enterprise Java Community: Introducing Apache Wicket">read the article</a> yourself, and comment on the article, or Wicket at <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=48234" title="Article: Introducing Apache Wicket">TheServerSide forum</a>.</p>
