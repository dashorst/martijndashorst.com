<p>We are announcing a special Wicket community event: on Tuesday April<br />
8th 2008 the next Apache Wicket Community Meetup will be held in<br />
Amsterdam just prior to ApacheCon.</p>
<p>This Meetup will be a low-barrier community driven event and free to<br />
attend, thanks to the generous sponsoring by <a title="Home - Hippo Open Source Enterprise Content Management" href="http://hippo.nl">Hippo</a> and <a title="Topicus: Topicus" href="http://www.topicus.nl">Topicus</a>. With<br />
the Apache Wicket Community Meetup we like to bring together not only<br />
project committers from Apache Wicket but also our community users and<br />
other interested parties.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-348"></a></p>
<p>You are hereby invited to attend and to propose a relevant subject<br />
you'd like to hear more about or even present yourself.</p>
<p>We've already talked to several people who definitely would like to<br />
come, so now is the time to sign up!</p>
<p>Register on the <a title="Wicket Community meetups - Amsterdam" href="http://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/wicket-community-meetups-amsterdam.html">Amsterdam Meetup Wiki page</a> to let us know you are interested, or even<br />
better: tell us you will come for sure!</p>
<p>Note: registering for the meeting doesn't require attendance, but we<br />
like to have a good indication who might be coming.</p>
<p>And if you have a good idea for a talk, presentation, demo,<br />
discussion, or whatever you feel like, be sure to add it to the Wiki<br />
page as well.</p>
<p>The meetup takes place during the second Hackaton day at the ApacheCon<br />
EU 2008, April 8th. Whereas this Meetup is purely about Apache Wicket,<br />
run by the community, ApacheCon gives you a much bigger overview<br />
covering the entire Apache stack. There's no obligation to attend<br />
ApacheCon, but we're trying to get a good deal for this Meetup<br />
attendees that want to visit ApacheCon too. For more info about<br />
ApacheCon EU 2008, take a look at the <a title="ApacheCon EU 2008" href="http://www.eu.apachecon.com/">conference website</a>.</p>
<p>The Wicket specific session at the ApacheCon you might want to attend is:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a title="ApacheCon EU 2008" href="http://eu.apachecon.com/eu2008/program/talk/2407">Apache Wicket - web development with just Java</a><br />
by Gerolf Seitz, Wednesday April 9th</li>
</ul>
<p>Arje Cahn, as member of the ApacheCon EU planners (and<br />
also co-organizer of the Wicket Meetup and serveral Cocoon Meetups in<br />
the past), is actively helping with facilitating additional community<br />
Meetings during the ApacheCon, and so far Portals and JackRabbit<br />
already have opted for this.</p>
<p>We will have a room and essential infrastructure (wireless network,<br />
free drinks) nearby the same building as where the ApacheCon is held,<br />
to organize our mini-conference about anything of interest for the<br />
Apache Wicket Community.</p>
<p>On the Wiki page you'll find already a few topics we think will be<br />
interesting, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>web framework shoot out: jsf vs tapestry vs wicket vs spring mvc</li>
<li>JAMon</li>
<li>what's next for Wicket</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check our <a title="Wicket Community meetups - Amsterdam" href="http://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/wicket-community-meetups-amsterdam.html">Amsterdam Meetup Wiki</a> page<br />
for the latest information, and you can also subscribe on the Wiki<br />
page to get notified when it is updated.</p>
<p>Anyone willing to discuss this Meetup or specific topics by mail is<br />
invited to do so by responding to this message on the users@...<br />
mailing list. Or you may contact myself directly (see email address<br />
below).</p>
<p>If you or your organization is interesting to helping out with this event<br />
(and get some sponsoring coverage/display too), please contact Arje Cahn,<br />
a.cahn(at)onehippo[dot]com</p>
<p>Thanks for your interest and see ya all in Amsterdam this April.</p>
