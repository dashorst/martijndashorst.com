<p>We just received word that our years old project, <a href="http://manning.com/dashorst">Wicket in Action</a>, has been approved for production. WOOHOO!!!!</p>
<p>There is light at the end of the tunnel. We are now renumbering the chapters (chapter 3 - setting up shop has been removed from the manuscript and will be made available as a free download) and getting them ready for copy-editing.</p>
