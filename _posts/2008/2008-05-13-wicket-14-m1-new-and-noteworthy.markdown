<p>Recently the Wicket team released the first milestone release of Wicket 1.4, the new and Java 5 based release that will supplant Wicket 1.3 rather soon. We have adopted the release schema of Eclipse as our M.O. to smooth the process of introducing (amongst others) <i>generics</i> into our code base.</p>
<p>In the same tradition as Eclipse, we now have our very own <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/wicket-14-m1-news.html">New and Noteworthy</a> release document for Wicket 1.4-m1.</p>
<p>Now I hear you ask... How can <strong>I</strong> help out? Well, you can! By using this milestone release and providing us feedback on how this release suits you.</p>
<p>
	Enjoy!</p>
