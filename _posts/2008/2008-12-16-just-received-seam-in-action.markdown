<p>Today I got my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933988401?ie=UTF8&tag=awidi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1933988401">Seam in Action</a>, which only mentions Wicket in name, but I didn't expect it to contain lots of Wicket related content, since the Wicket integration just came of age recently (Seam in Action was published early 2008, which is ages ago). I'm curious to learn more about Seam... (but the book has to compete with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882?ie=UTF8&tag=awidi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0132350882">Clean Code</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=awidi-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0132350882" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /><br />
for my attention)</p>
