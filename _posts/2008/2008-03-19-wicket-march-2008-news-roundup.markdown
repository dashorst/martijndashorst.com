<p>A lot has happened and still happening in Wicket land this month. Here's a summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eelco got married (actually in Februari but who's counting)</li>
<li>We spent a great deal of time on an exotic beach in Thailand celebrating that fact</li>
<li>Wicket in Action is now in production, meaning that Eelco and I are spending our evenings (and part of the night) applying copy editor improvements, indexing and creating production ready images</li>
<li>Apache Wicket 1.3.2 has been released</li>
<li>Wicket in Action is the best selling MEAP book for Manning</li>
<li>Maurice Marrink has joined the Wicket team</li>
<li>A new Wicket Community Meetup is in the works (April 8th, Amsterdam)</li>
<li>The next Wicket version will be a quick one: only generics and a migration to Java 5 (at least looking at the vote results so far)</li>
</ul>
<p>You are invited to the <a title="Wicket Community meetups - Amsterdam" href="http://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/wicket-community-meetups-amsterdam.html">Wicket meetup</a>, and to <a title="[vote] Release 1.4 with only generics and stop support for 1.3" href="http://www.nabble.com/-vote--Release-1.4-with-only-generics-and-stop-support-for-1.3-td16090054.html">cast your vote</a> for the (immediate) future of Wicket.</p>
