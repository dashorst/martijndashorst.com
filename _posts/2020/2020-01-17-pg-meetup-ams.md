title: "PostgreSQL Meetup: Converting 85% of Dutch Primary Schools from Oracle to PostgreSQL"
---

I have been invited to give my talk "CONVERTING 85% OF DUTCH PRIMARY SCHOOLS FROM ORACLE TO POSTGRESQL" at the Amsterdam PostgreSQL meetup on Thursday, 30 January.

You can [register for this Meetup here][register].

The description of the talk:

> **CONVERTING 85% OF DUTCH PRIMARY SCHOOLS FROM ORACLE TO POSTGRESQL**
>
> This case study describes migrating the most used application for primary schools in the Netherlands from Oracle to PostgreSQL. The application uses a multi-tenant, single schema database (i.e. 6000 schools in a single database) and runs using a typical Java EE frontend.
>
> You will learn about our application architecture, hardware platform, reasons for switching, migration strategies considered and the results of our migration.
> 
> Since the CFP closed one week before our actual migration we can't reveal the results in this abstract, but the presentation will capture all the things that went wrong and well

Hope to see you there!
