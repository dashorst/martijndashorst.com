title: "Installing Windows 10 on a M.2 Drive"
---

When you want to install Windows 10 on a M.2 NVME drive, you have to
make sure you download the correct Windows installation media otherwise
the installer won't discover your M.2 drive.

**THIS TOOK ME 8 HOURS TO FIGURE OUT**

When you go to the [Windows 10 download page][1] it doesn't tell you in
any way that the ISO is completely and utterly unable to install onto a
M.2 drive. When you do go down this route--and I urge you not to do
that--you will be presented at the beginning of the installation that
you need additional drivers.

You have to use the [Installation Media Creation Tool][2] using an
existing installation of Windows to create an USB installation, _not_
the DVD/ISO.

Fortunately (**NOT**), Microsoft directs you to the ISO download when
you try to access the Media Creation Tool page so you assume that the
ISO Just Worksâ„¢.

Don't be like me, don't waste 8 hours of your precious time in
frustration and just create the USB media installation media.

PS. If all you have is macOS, you can try to download [Virtual Box][3]
and the [Microsoft Edge test virtual machine][4] to run the Installation
Media Creation Tool.
