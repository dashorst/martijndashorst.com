  content: Hey!  The real window managers don't need this feature because you never
    *leave* the command prompt.  :-)

    You might want to check out the 12ghosts ShellX extension at www.12ghosts.com/ghosts/shellx.htm

    BTW I think Wicket is a breath of fresh air in the web framework world...

I'm used to working on a Windows XP box, and one of the first things I do is either install the powertoys, and especially the Open Command prompt here plugin for the explorer. This plugin basically does the following.</p>
<p>
It allows you to navigate to a folder using explorer, and when you click using the right button on the folder, you are given the possiblity to open a command prompt box (dos box) with the prompt waiting in that directory. This is quite a time saver since you don't have to navigate yourself to that directory using those dreaded 'cd' commands.</p>
<p>
This was one feature that I missed after I started using OSX on my power mac. But just a couple of minutes ago, I <a href="http://www.google.com">Googled</a> for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=osx+finder+terminal+here&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">"osx finder terminal here"</a> and got to an <a href="http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/macgems/2005/11/openterminalhere/index.php">article</a> that specifically targetted my problem.</p>
<p>
And yes: it works great! No more 'cd' typing, just <a href="http://www.pyehouse.com/lynn/termopen.php">open terminal here</a>.</p>
