  content: "Wicket is a great framework and it needs a little bit more PR. I've voted
    for this framework and asked my colleagues to do so. Even my wife blindly voted
    for Wicket ;) \nBest Regards!"

<p>There are 2 days left (European time) to cast your vote in the <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/awards/cca">SourceForge Community Awards '06</a>. I rounded up my family and friends to vote for <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a>, and I hope you will also choose to support Wicket.</p>
<p>
As someone with an interest in Java development (otherwise you wouldn't be reading JRoller) you might want to support the nominated Java projects in this award show. Prove that Java isn't dead, vote for your favorite Java projects (I just hope Wicket is one of them).</p>
