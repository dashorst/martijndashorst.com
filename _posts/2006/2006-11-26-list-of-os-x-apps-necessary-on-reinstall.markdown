  content: Good idea. Wonder why you didn't just run System Profiler tho? Would have
    made a much more complete/useful list for rebuild at a  later date...

<p>This list is not a top 10 apps I prefer, but a reminder that whenever I am going to reinstall my OS X drive (due soon, again because bootcamp needs an unpartitioned drive to function):</p>
<ul>
<li>QuickSilver (productivity enhancing application launcher)</li>
<li>SuperDuper (backup utility)</li>
<li>OmniGraffle (best diagram drawing tool I know)</li>
<li>ToDos (not a todo-list manager, provides an overview of all OS X apps installed)</li>
<li>Growl (notification utility)</li>
<li>adium (multi protocol chat client)</li>
<li>skype</li>
<li>colloquy (provides access to ##wicket @irc.freenode.net)</li>
<li>textmate (a decent text editor)</li>
<li><a href="http://metissian.com/projects/macosx/subversion/">svn client</a></li>
<li>xcode (provides cvs commandline functionality, web objects, etc. editor for Java seems obsolete with Eclipse)</li>
<li>iBackup (backup utility)</li>
<li>iWork'06 (keynote and pages)</li>
<li>iAlertU (alarm for those moments you have to leave your notebook alone)</li>
<li>pzizz (get those refreshing naps)</li>
<li>SSH Agent (no more password reminders)</li>
<li>transmit (FTP client)</li>
<li>YourKit (<b>the best Java profiler</b></li>
<li>sidenote (stickies but then to the side of your screen)</li>
<li>scrivener (screenplay, notes taker, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I don't use <em>all</em> programs at a regular basis. For instance, I don't use, haven't used scrivener much, though I do like the idea and think I wouldn't mind using it. </p>
