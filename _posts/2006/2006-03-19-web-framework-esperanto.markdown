    Out of context that sounds a little funny since Esperanto is a failed artificial language.  Here's the whole quote (which is actually a compliment):

    'One additional point?compared to other web frameworks, Wicket is ideal to cut your teeth on in terms of providing tooling support for web frameworks: it is simple (doesn't have the added hassle of dealing with XML configuration files) and is very regular. It kind of makes me feel as if I'm working with the Esperanto of the web framework world."

On <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/geertjan">Geertjan's blog</a>, Geertjan shows his affection for the <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> web framework as he is writing tutorials for <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">Netbeans</a> modules, and creates <a href="http://jroller.com/page/JonathanLocke?entry=will_it_be_time_soon">excellent IDE support</a> as an afterthought. IDE support is critical for many developers, and with <a href="http://www.laughingpanda.org/mediawiki/index.php/Wicket_Bench">Eclipse (Wicket Bench)</a> and <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/geertjan?entry=wicket_increasing_productivity_even_further2">Netbeans</a> support for <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> the future is bright!</p>
<p>
In other news, I just released  the second beta for <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket 1.2</a>. The release is available for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=119783">immediate download</a> and coming to a SourceForge mirror near you in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>
<em>Help us finalize Wicket 1.2 by downloading this release and test it.</em> And while you are browsing the SourceForge servers, why don't you <a href="http://www.wilsonresearch.com/2006/ostgawards06/ostgawards4.php">vote for Wicket</a> along the way?</p>
