    Is there any place we we can see the Wicket roadmap?
    What about the support for JSR168?

    I really want to use Wcket in our company for the next version of our web portal application, but I'm concerned about development plan of Wicket framework.

    But Wicket looks solid and great.
    Keet the good work

    wicket-1.2.1-rc1 pom.xml references artifactId wicket-parent, which isn't distributed.

<p>I released <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=119783&package_id=173489">Wicket 1.2.1-rc1</a>, the first (and probably last) release candidate for the Wicket 1.2.1 maintenance release.</p>
<p>
It would be very helpful if you download and test this release, so we can ship 1.2.1 final later this week.</p>
