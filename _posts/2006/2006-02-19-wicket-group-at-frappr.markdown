  content: Cool!  Would be neat to have this posted on the Wicket home page somewhere
    so people in the future can join up.

<p>I just created a <a href="http://www.frappr.com/wicket">Frappr group</a> for the <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a> project. Feel free to add yourself to the group if you feel connected to the Wicket community.</p>
<p>
The best thing I like about a Frappr map is to see how diverse the community is of Wicket. I know that we have quite a following in the far east, and it would be nice to see the dots on the world map and discover the global diversity of our community.</p>
<p>
Currently there is only one member (myself), but I hope to see the group growing quickly! Join me, it is lonely <a href="http://www.frappr.com/wicket/">out there</a>!</p>
