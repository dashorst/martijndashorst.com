<p>A <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/karthikg?entry=wicket_and_ajax">great blog entry</a> (and a rather lengthy one at that) on the new AJAX features of the <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket framework</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/karthikg">Karthik Guru</a> has been using Wicket not too long, and is already enjoying it, and using quite some advanced features of the upcoming Wicket 1.2 release.</p>
<p>
In his article Karthik works his way from a standard Wicket form to an AJAXified form that validates when the fields of the form loose their focus ('onblur'). The application then makes a validation AJAX roundtrip to the server and updates both the field component and the validation messages on the page.</p>
<p>
Definitely worth a read when you want to catch up on the progress <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> has made in this regard. I hope we can see more of these articles from Karthik and other users!</p>
