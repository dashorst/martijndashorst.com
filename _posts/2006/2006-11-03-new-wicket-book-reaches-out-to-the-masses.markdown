<p>çŽ‹ç£Š (Wang Lei) has his target audience right: 1 billion Chinese waiting to start working with <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> can't be a bad thing for a book, even though the book is free.</p>
<p>
çŽ‹ç£Š has written a <a href="http://gocom.primeton.com/">book concerning Wicket</a> in <em>Chinese</em> in 6 weeks and it reads <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=zh_en&trurl=http%3a%2f%2fgocom.primeton.com%2fWicketDG%2fWicketDG00.php">remarkably well</a> when put through the Babelfish translator. </p>
<p>
I'm thrilled to see such support for the Wicket framework and I hope our community will grow even further in the far east.</p>
<p>If you can't see the name of Wang Lei correct, it is because you don't have the Chinese font installed (<a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/">get a mac!</a>, it works out of the box).</p>
