  content: We'd be happy to assist you in moving to JavaForge.com, of course that
    will require moving to Subversion (CVS is likely to come soon).  Signup, create
    a project and see how you like it.  We can find ways to make sure your history
    is imported I believe.  We also allow anonymous read access to your subversion
    repository.

    Hi Matthew, thanks for the offer. Maybe we'll take you up on your offer.

    The only thing is, we like the current sf.net support, so we would only make use of your SVN availability. Our only problem is the anonymous CVS support.

  content: I'm a core member of dotProject and we ran into a similar thing quite a
    while ago, so we made a task that takes a nightly snapshot and then just makes
    that available.

<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> as it makes collaborative development for open source projects work. It may not have the best bug tracker, forum software etc, but considering the scale of the site, I am awed by their efforts.</p>
<p>
The only real problem I have with SourceForge it the anonymous CVS. Apparently it rarely works (as a committer you get SSH access, which almost always works), considering the number of complaints on our mailinglists. This has raised the question of whether we should stay at SourceForge or move to another open source portal.</p>
<p>
I rarely see support tickets on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=200001&amp;group_id=1&amp;func=browse">SourceForge support trackers</a> regarding anonymous CVS. Is the Sourceforge support staff even aware that there is a problem?</p>
