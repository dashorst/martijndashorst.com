    Keep a good work dashorst.

    I always believe that Wicket is most intrest, powerful and sexy web-framework for Java. Brilliant future waiting for this framework.

    If I would return to java land I would promote for my project only Wicket, not any other WebFramework.

    Thanks for your great job.

    <i>Though I have seen several references between sex and Wicket</i>
    lol

    This is another example of the world catching up to America in IT.  Lately, when I search for a technical question, more and more sites are foreign.

  content: That line should mean we may use the inheritability of component to design
    our application, no sex :)

<p>Though even after <a href="http://google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fjava.chinaitlab.com%2FStruts%2F42323.html&langpair=zh-CN%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF8">automatic translation</a> largely uncomprehensible, I found <a href="http://java.chinaitlab.com/Struts/42323.html">this article in ChinaItLab</a>. From the translation:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Wicket is completely object-oriented. We may inherit the sex using the module design oneself the application. Here does not need for to process the HTTP agreement the request / response does any work.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Though I have seen several references between sex and Wicket, this one is by far the most explicit link, and should entice many Java geeks to try out Wicket <i>JUST IN CASE</i>.</p>
<p>With the continuing attention for the <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket Framework</a> in the far east, it seems that even without JavaOne Tokyo, Wicket gains momentum.</p>
