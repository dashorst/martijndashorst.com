  content: Me and my stabbing. One of these days, someone's going to stab back. Perhaps,

<p>In a very <a href="http://technically.us/n8/articles/tag/java">entertaining blog entry</a> Nathan explains the pains he has had with integrating the basic security package provided with <a href="http://wicketframework.org/wicket-1.2">Wicket 1.2</a> While showing off his neat integrated security functionality, he takes a stab at Spring, and PHP. I promise, Nathan, next project I start up will be <a href="http://databinder.net/">databinder</a> based :-).</p>
