  content: I'm mostly listetning to the radio, as long as there're others in the room.
    If not, I prefer a bit of everything. Audioslave, Third Eye Blind, Dave Matthews
    Band, Gemma Hayes, HIves, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Rollins Band and from time to time
    some German stuff (as that's it who and where I am)..

  content: I find that anything with too much variation distracts me... I end up singing
    along in my head.  Daft Punk is my favorite coding music because of its repetitive
    driving beats.

    My guessing is that you want to check out some new music, these days (I'm trying to learn Japanese :)), so, I came across some wonderful japanese songs, the best till now is Kojima Myumi, Man she is wonderfull, I almost like all of her songs (although I only get few words) :)

    One of her songs was used in a famous Nentendo comercial. check her out, I think you will find a song or two that you like (if not all) ;) .

<p>just browsing through the music collection of a coworker, I found Marilyn Manson. Of course I had to listen to this person that was horribly pestered during his high school years (why else would you paint your face white and wear stockings?).</p>
<p>
And I must say the sound is very muzak to me. I don't get the urge to buy a three barrel shotgun and shoot my coworkers. I even don't get the vibe to go head butting them to the chest.</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's some nice background music for those heated days (28C ~= 82F and rising).</p>
<p>
My current favorite choices for music are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thievery Corporation</li>
<li>Supper club</li>
<li>Global Underground</li>
<li>St Germain</li>
<li>Linkin Park</li>
<li>Jamiroquai</li>
<li>Shakira</li>
</ul>
<p>I found out about Thievery Corporation through reading a blog on music preferences while coding, so what music do you listen to in your cubicle?</p>
