  content: "There exists a simple strategy to increase dramatically the  downloads
    stats : split your releases in many files.\nCheck the zk project on sourceforge.
    This project is in the top 5 !!! \nIf you want to download a release you have
    to download 10 files !! (there is a file that contains one page !)\nYou have 60
    new users a day you get 600 downloads !\nVery easy indeed !"

  content: LOL, thanks for the tip... I guess we won't go for that option. Releasing
    Wicket already takes about 4 hours, including the upload process. Imagine 60+
    files to upload... :-)

<p>Is it me, or has SourceForge.net updated its activity statistics? Wicket is now in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group_id=119783&ugn=wicket">top 25 most active projects</a> on sourceforge, but we haven't done anything on our part to improve our stats. Not that I'm complaining or anything...</p>
