<p>I usually don't blog about personal things, and write just about Wicket, or any new, Java related subject I'm excited about, but I'm breaking that habit for this time...</p>
<p>What is the fascination cats have with closed doors? Everytime we shut a door to keep the draft out, a cat immediately wants us to open that door. Sometimes she'll even grant you 5 minutes couch time, but I just think that is the time they need to realize the door has been shut.</p>
<p>Is there any scientific research being done on how long a cat can be in a (large) room with a closed door before she starts to scratch?</p>
