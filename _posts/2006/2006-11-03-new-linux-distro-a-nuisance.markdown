<p>The Free Software Foundation (FSF) has <a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS7506163557.html">released a new Linux distribution</a> called: <b>gNewSense</b>.</p>
<p>
Apart from the question of whether the world is ready for yet another linux distribution (which outnumbers the total of web frameworks, all languages combined) I find the choice of name pretty strange. With some fantasy you could speak it like: "Gnu-sense", but that can be quickly misunderstood for "Nuisance".</p>
<p>
In that respect, the name is chosen correctly: with all proprietary code removed from the distribution, the distribution can only be regarded by the casual (non-Free software ideologist) as a nuisance. I applaud the effort of the FSF for making a completely <em>free</em> operating system though, and I wish them well.</p>
