Now if I only could use IDEA (somehow we didn't get our license renewed). Problem with IDE's is that you need to work with them full time, otherwise they get in the way. I'd love to give IDEA a go, but I can't use an open source license for work. I'm happy with Eclipse, but I would like to confirm the productivity improvements people claim to have when they made the switch.</p>
