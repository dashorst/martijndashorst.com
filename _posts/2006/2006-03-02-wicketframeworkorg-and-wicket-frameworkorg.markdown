  content: Shouldn't we at least contact whoever owns wicket.org?  That's a more natural
    name.  Maybe they would be willing to sell it to us for a couple of bucks (obviously
    not much)...

    The company that owns wicket.org specifically states on their page that the domain is not for sale.

    As far as wicket.net, the price is $1000 or so. wicketframework.org is not too hard, it works for spring, so why not for us?

I just registered a couple of top level domain names for the <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket project</a>. It will take a while until all DNS servers have caught up with the newly registered domain names, and until sourceforge has synched all vhost settings.</p>
<p>
So what are our toplevel domain names?</p>
<p><ul>
<li><a href="http://wicketframework.org">wicketframework.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wicket-framework.org">wicket-framework.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Now we only need to determine which of the two feels best, and causes the least strain on the fingers of our users.</p>
