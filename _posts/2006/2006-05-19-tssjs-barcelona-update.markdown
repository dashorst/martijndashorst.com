    Hi Eelco!

    I know how it feels. I've been doing this for this beginning of the year to push InfoQ.com out. Keeping the pace with the OSS projects I am contributing was another challenge. But than, when you succeed it is sooo rewarding.

    Hi Alex,

    No hard feelings, I'll keep you to that beer offer though... ;-)

<p>After quite some hard labor, making days of about 16 hours screen time, I have submitted my presentation for the <a href="http://javasymposium-europe.techtarget.com/">European Serverside Java Symposium</a>. I hope to see you there!</p>
<p>
Note to self: writing a book, working fulltime on several key projects, working on open source projects, working on publicity is not good for social life.</p>
