  content: Go for it! We're anxiously awaiting. We use jWebUnit at agillaire and we
    think it's a very solid framework. It definitely could use some enhancements.
    I have a developer in my team who will be very interested in contributing as well....

<p>My first open source project I got involved in hasn't got the attention it deserved. As such it was pretty much a dead project. Personally I had much more fun and invested more time in <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a>, but a month ago I made a great decision for <a href="http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net">jWebUnit</a>.</p>
<p>
After almost 2 years of inactivity, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/userpermedit.php?group_id=61302&amp;user_id=1235926">Julien Henry</a>, a french student working on his last intern project for Cap Gemini, is working very hard to give <a href="http://jwebunit.sf.net">jWebUnit</a> a fresh release.</p>
<p>
Julien presented himself to our very small developer community:</p>
<blockquote><p>
My name's Julien, and I'm a french student. I'm currently doing my final<br />
internship in Capgemini. I work on functional testing of web<br />
application, and it led me to try Mercury Quicktest, JStudio, Webtest,<br />
HttpUnit, HtmlUnit, jWebUnit and finally Selenium (now Selenium RC). I<br />
also work on the migration of our applications under Maven 2.<br />
I hope I could help jWebUnit to raise, as I think it's one of the best<br />
solution I tested.</p></blockquote>
<p>
If the folks at Cap Gemini require some input on giving Julien a grade, I'll gladly give him the credentials he deserves. jWebUnit looks better than before and I'm still seeing much progress.</p>
<p>
jWebUnit now has several testrunners for different test frameworks:</p>
<ul>
<li>httpunit (old style)</li>
<li>htmlunit (new!)</li>
<li>jacobie (use internet explorer)</li>
<li>selenium (new!)</li>
</ul>
<p>
I most certainly hope Julien will give jWebUnit better Javascript support, and that we'll be seeing support for testing Ajax in the near future!</p>
<p>
Go Julien!</p>
