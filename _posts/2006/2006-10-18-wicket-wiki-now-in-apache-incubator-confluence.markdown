<p>As part of becoming an Apache project, we imported the contents of the <a href="http://wicket.sf.net/wiki">Wicket Wiki</a> to Apache's confluence. To make this a one time switch and since we are adamant that we will go through the incubator swiftly and become a full fledged, top level Apache project, we have made our old Wiki read only.</p>
<p>
You can find our new Wiki here: <a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/">http://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/</a>, and details regarding the move are to be found <a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/wiki-move.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>
Now we have almost everything in place. Just the website and a finished JIRA import. Unfortunately we are all extremely occupied with our day jobs and our night jobs (writing a book for instance), so this might take a bit longer than previously expected.</p>
