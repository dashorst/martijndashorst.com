<p>Yahoo has released a new version of their <a href="http://com1.devnet.scd.yahoo.com/yui/">UI library</a>. The Yahoo user interface library is a collection of very sofisticated and thought through JavaScript widgets.</p>
<p>
The library consists of many things, a short list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autocomplete</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Container (Dialog, SimpleDialog, Overlay, Tooltip, etc)</li>
<li>Menu</li>
<li>Slider</li>
<li>Treeview</li>
</ul>
<p>
And now they also have a library of CSS tools, with some basic, but very bright ideas. I especially like the idea of <a href="http://com1.devnet.scd.yahoo.com/yui/reset/">CSS Reset</a>, which resets all markup formatting to plain rendering for all browsers, so that you can build your own flexible, cross browser stylesheet.</p>
<p>
There is some work under way to make all this goodness available for <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> users in this <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/wicket-stuff/trunk/wicket-contrib-yui/">Wicket YUI project</a>.</p>
<p>
If my hands weren't tied to a strict deadline at work, writing a book on Wicket and preparing for <a href="http://javasymposium-europe.techtarget.com/html/js_at_a_glance.htm">TSSJS Europe</a>, I would have dugg into the Yahoo library and helped out with the widget project...</p>
<p>
Ah... the choices we make...</p>
