  content: "I've been using Drupal for a couple of years now. It's pretty easy to
    set up and to extend with custom modules and themes. \n\nMake sure you get on
    the security mailing list, though.  The PHP platform is still evolving, and there
    have been a couple of times when the mailing list has alerted me to some pretty
    serious issues."

<p>I just posted my first JavaLobby article regarding <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a>. In this article I try to give you a heads up on <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t69357.html">markup inheritance</a>.</p>
<p>It's not a  publish once effort: it will be integrated in our own <a href="http://wicketframework.org">website</a> when our next release is up. That is the advantage when you write your own articles: you can publish it anywhere you want, any number of times.</p>
<p>On the documentation front we are making some progress, as we will be moving our website's content into a real CMS. We have chosen <a href="http://drupal.org">drupal</a> as it seems to be one of the best CMS's out there, with great community and we have some knowledge about it as well. And it's good enough for <a href="http://www.springframework.org">Spring</a>, so it wouldn't hurt us either.</p>
<p>I know that we should have implemented our own CMS using Wicket, but that is a lot of work, better spent at improving Wicket for <em>you</em>. And of course, one of our own community members is <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/wicket-stuff/trunk/wicket-contrib-cms/">already working on it</a>.</p>
