<p><a href="http://www.technically.us/n8/">Nathan</a> blogged a while back about Ruby on Rails and which Java frameworks are best to compete with it. He <a href="http://www.technically.us/n8/articles/2005/11/18/java-vs-ruby-on-rails-deathmatch">tips</a> Wicket as the best Java framework for this purpose, but still has some doubts on the statefulness of Wicket applications.</p>
