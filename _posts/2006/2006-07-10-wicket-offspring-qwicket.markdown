  content: Would you believe that "Quicket" was a Databinder name I considered, and
    decided against? I thought that something sounding so similar to "Wicket" would
    confuse people.

  content: I believe this is going into the right direction. But I think what we (java
    web developers who want to create simple things *fast*) need first is a good java
    wrapping framework (http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-cb03076/index.html).

<p><a href="http://antwerkz.com/wp">Justin Lee</a> has created an appfuse like project generator for <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> applications: <a href="http://www.antwerkz.com/wp/?p=1006">QWicket</a>.</p>
<p>
QWicket is a project that is hosted on the <a href="http://qwicket.sf.net">SourceForge</a> servers, and promises rapid development for your Wicket applications. Can't wait to download the first release!</p>
<p>
It is nice to see more and more projects spawning to aid the development of Wicket applications. Next to our community projects hosted on <a href="http://wicket-stuff.sf.net">Wicket Stuff</a>, we already have projects for IDE support (<a href="http://www.laughingpanda.org/mediawiki/index.php/Wicket_Bench">Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://nbwicketsupport.dev.java.net/">NetBeans</a>), we have <a href="http://databinder.net">Databinder</a> for quick Hibernate applications, and now <a href="http://qwicket.sf.net">QWicket</a>.</p>
