  content: Er, how many web frameworks can Apache host?  Aren't you guys afraid of
    being lost in the piles that are already there?

<p>In a bold maneuver we transfered our <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> subversion repository to the <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/incubator/wicket/">Apache Incubator SVN repository</a>. Now we are officially undergoing incubation.</p>
<p>
For our users we don't expect any changes in the near future, unless you are working off of SVN trunk or head of our 1.x branch.</p>
<p>
Don't be a stranger, but join us at Apache for our development and subscribe to the wicket-development list by sending a subscribe message to 'wicket-dev-subscribe at incubator dot apache dot org' and follow the instructions.</p>
