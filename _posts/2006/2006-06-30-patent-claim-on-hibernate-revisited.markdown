    With this rush to get rich using stupid ideas, I was thinking that we should patent the "." usage in source code. Than I guess all of us behind this initiative will be in a couple of days the richest boys in town.

    stupid software patents... SOFTWARE PATENTS ARE BAD AND STUPID

<p>Acccording to <a href="http://infoq.com">InfoQ</a> the patent case against Hibernate was <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/RedHat-Sued-Due-to-Hibernate-3-O">meticulously planned</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li>They filed the suit in the one place where no patent case was lost</li>
<li>They filed the suit right within the JBoss Red Hat due dilligence period (either instant settlement by JBoss or a possible cancellation of the acquisition)</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately we haven't heard the last of this.</p>
<p>
Repeat after me:</p>
<h1>Software Patents Are Bad</h1>
