  content: "Honestly I'm not too impressed with the looks of this portal. Compare
    this to the google personalized page, netvibes, the liferay demo, infoq etc..
    They all provide a much nicer UI and better interactivity. \n\nThe hungarian portal
    looks pretty 90's. Additionally all the \"portlets\" seem to be sourced from the
    same web app making this more of a traditional web app rather than a portal."

  content: "Thanks guys,\n\n\"can't remember seeing him on our mailinglists\"\n\nI
    was subscribed when 1.1 came out, but had no time to read the mails. I don't remember
    sending any e-mails.\n\nSzeretgom.hu is actually just a small project I'm doing
    in my spare time to help out the local community. Sanjiv is right, it's not a
    real portal in the sense SAP, IBM, Sun and others are using the word - it is becoming
    more like a content management web application that is used for a local community
    of maximum 30-50 thousand people.\n\nBTW, I spent only two weekends writing code
    and browsing documentation or the examples - so it's a maximum of 35-40 man-hours
    of work you are seeing there. Also I'm not a designer and although the whole thing
    is CSS based I don't like spending much time doing gimp work, finding colours
    that match, etc.\n\nI've used many technologies before (started my web development
    with perl, then php, moved to java servlets, jsp, struts, jsf) and so far I find
    wicket to be a very productive tool. \n\nOh, and it's still 1.2rc3 under the covers
    - but it's running on a beta app server...:)\n\nBTW, I have a quite basic BBLabel
    and BBMultiLineLabel component that may be of use to someone else - should I contribute
    them to wicket-stuff?"

<p><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/csj">JÃ¡nos CserÃ©p</a> has created a Wicket based <a href="http://www.szeretgom.hu/">portal in Hungarian</a>. I can't remember seeing him on our mailinglists, but it looks great, and is probably the first <a href="http://wicketframework.org/wicket-1.2">Wicket 1.2</a> application in production and externally visible.</p>
<p>
Now if I only get some time to pick up my hungarian lessons. Szia!</p>
