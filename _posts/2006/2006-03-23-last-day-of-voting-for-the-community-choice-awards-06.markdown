<p>Today is the last day you can vote for the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/awards/cca">SourceForge.net Community Choice Awards '06</a>. You can vote for <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> in the Development category.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>I've voted for this framework and asked my colleagues to do so. Even my wife blindly voted for Wicket ;)</i></p></blockquote>
<p>
This is a comment on my blog. I can't say I'm not guilty of this as well. I have pressured my family, my inlaws and my co-workers into voting for Wicket: "Vote for Wicket or Else...". I stopped at the "Else" part, because the left out part was: "you don't vote". Yes I'm a wuss.</p>
