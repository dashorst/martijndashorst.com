    Just a question...

    Don't struts lead anyway since WebWork joined Struts? eg giving them 30%...

<p>The <a href="http://canetrash.seesaa.net/">Nippon Web Framework Smackdown</a> has created some confusion on what the numbers mean, but today (or yesterday), the author <a href="http://canetrash.seesaa.net/article/11644197.html">unveiled the true meaning</a> of the numbers and ranking. Or better put: as far as I could tell from the <a href="http://google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcanetrash.seesaa.net%2F&langpair=ja%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF8">Japanese to English</a> translation by <a href="http://google.com/translate">Google</a>...</p>
<p>
This time he also included <a href="http://struts.apache.org">Struts</a> into the graph and had refreshed the numbers:</p>
<p>
<a href="http://canetrash.seesaa.net/article/11644197.html"><img src="http://canetrash.up.seesaa.net/image/nextWebframework.gif" /></a></p>
<p>
So you can see: <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a> even beats Struts...</p>
<p>
For those that are too lazy to read the article itself, apparently it is the number of <a href="http://del.icio.us/">delicious</a> bookmarks for each framework. Strange thing: I searched for wicket on the delicious website, and I only got 171 hits. I'm not complaining though!</p>
