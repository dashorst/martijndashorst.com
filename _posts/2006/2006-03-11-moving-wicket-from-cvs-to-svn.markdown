  content: Hurray!  I'm glad to hear that this is happening... SVN is really quite
    a bit better than CVS.

<p>The <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> CVS repository is moving to <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge's</a> subversion service. We have had a rough time living on CVS and are hoping that this move will solve many of the connectivity problems our users are experiencing. We also hope that the window between a developer commit and the availability of the change for our users will be minimized.</p>
<p>
Due to some problems with the daily backup of CVS, we haven't been able to move our repository. Sourceforge staff was kind enough to supply us with a fresh tarball, which I'm currently converting to subversion.</p>
