    I stumbled across this too.  It's intriguing for sure.  As happy as I am with the progress Stripes has made, I find it quite hard to believe that it is beating out WebWork yet ;)  Makes me wonder if these are mindshare stats as opposed to usage stats?

    units they used. It is not represented on the diagram apparently because of its
    evil nature ;)

    It's the number of times the framework homepage figures as a del.icio.us bookmark.
    The clue is the first line of the translated document.

<p>There is something <a href="http://google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcanetrash.seesaa.net%2F&langpair=ja%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF8">magical about Wicket</a>, but I'm having a hard time to put a finger on it...</p>
<p><a href="http://canetrash.seesaa.net/"><img></a></p>
<p>Graph taken from <a href="http://canetrash.seesaa.net/">http://canetrash.seesaa.net/</a></p>
<p>The way the numbers are generated seems to be a secret, and probably means something mysterious...</p>
<p>Funny how the language barrier makes such articles unclear, even after automatic translation. But for now I'm not complaining (I think it is a positive article on Wicket).</p>
