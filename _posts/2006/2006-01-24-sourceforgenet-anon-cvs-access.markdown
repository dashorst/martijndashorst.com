<p>Apparently complaining at their support site about non-working CVS access helps. I just checked out Wicket from anon CVS and it worked. Not as fast as developer CVS through SSH, but they do listen.</p>
<p>
Now next time you have problems with anonymous CVS access, just file a bug report. They might even solve the problem.</p>
