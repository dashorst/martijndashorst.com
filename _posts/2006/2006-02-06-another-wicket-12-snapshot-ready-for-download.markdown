<p>I have been uploading development versions of the <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a> framework for the last couple of weeks, and they are in good demand. This version contains the preliminary version of our own Wicket Ajax integration, without a dependency on other Ajax libraries.</p>
<p>
We don't want to introduce another framework, and will keep supporting <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">Dojo</a> and <a href="http://scrip.taculo.us">Scriptaculous</a> as always, however we found that we should provide our basic users a good solid Ajax integration out of the box. By building one ourselves, we don't get hairy licensing issues, or become part of some war on Ajax frameworks. And we have it just /work/.</p>
<p>
Anyway, there are a couple of entries in the making about Wicket's new Ajax support and my adventures with Behaviour.js and Prototype.js. I <i>REALLY</i> like those frameworks.</p>
