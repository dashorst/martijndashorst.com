<p>It has been a while since I blogged about anything <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> related. This was mainly because of two projects that took away all my time.</p>
<p>
The first project is a 12 person, Wicket based, student administration system for high schools (you know, those pescy adolescents between ages 12 and 18), developed at <a href="http://onderwijs.topicus.nl">Topicus Onderwijs</a>. The project has gone live a couple of weeks ago and did so <i>without a hitch</i>. At first we started with about 90 concurrent sessions, and we will gradually see this rise to about 400 concurrent sessions until the end of the year. Unfortunately I can't show you anything from inside the application (student information is protected by law), but we're working on our external site.</p>
<p>
The other project that takes the rest of my time is writing <em>Wicket in Action</em> together with <a href="http://chillenious.wordpress.com">Eelco Hillenius</a> and Janne Hietamaki. Today I finished a chapter that was long overdue and is something most of you are looking forward to read about: Models. I tried to keep the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/18/earlyshow/main2016638.shtml">'Super Models need to be thin'</a> type of puns to a minimum. I think the chapter is in great shape and I hope our editor agrees. The coming weeks I'll be writing my other assigned chapters.</p>
<p>
With all this hard work one would almost forget about our <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/WicketProposal">incubation</a> at Apache. With <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> blocking all mail to the mailinglists originating from gmail accounts, it is fortunate that we now have our first <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-wicket-dev/">mailinglist</a> available at Apache. Subscribing this new list to <a href="http://www.nabble.com">Nabble</a> is already undertaken.</p>
<p>
Thanks Upayavira for making the mailinglist happen!</p>
