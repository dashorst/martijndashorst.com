  content: Done! The only other category where I found anything familiar for my ear
    was Games. ScummVM it is. These old LucasArts games are great, and the music is
    awesome! ScummVM made my day when I learned about its existence. Do you think
    people will be playing Wicket in 15 years like they play "The Monkey Island" or
    "Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis" now? ;-)

    Heh, wicket games. Hmm I wish I had more time available for writing such apps. Too bad the wayback machine doesn't cache the serverside of web apps :-).

    Anyway, I think we'll all have a big laugh at the way we develop applications in this era in about 15 years :-) and the religious debates that took place.
