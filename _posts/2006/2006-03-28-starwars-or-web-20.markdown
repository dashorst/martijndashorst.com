<p>A nice <a href="http://www.cerado.com/web20quiz.htm">Web 2.0 quiz</a> which tests your knowledge of Starwars characters and Web 2.0 products, frameworks and tools. They cateogorized <a href="http://wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> wrong! Not only is Wicket a <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/wicketwwarrick/">furry, ferosious Ewok</a> but also a <a href="http://wicketframework.org">web application framework</a> quite suitable for web 2.0-ness.</p>
<p>
So in my opinion, the radio button should be a checkbox, and you should get a bonus for having both correct!</p>
<p>
PS. my score was 34. It should have been 35, if they had given Wicket the correct score. Thanks KJB, for pointing me to this quiz!</p>
