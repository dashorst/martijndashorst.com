excerpt: At the <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/summaries/2010/October2010-public-minutes.html">JCP
  EC meeting</a> in October 2010 Oracle stated that "allowing the conversation to
  go forward" is more important than abiding by the JSPA rules, forcing Doug Lea to
  <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/jcp22oct10.html">resign his position on
  the JCP EC</a>.

  content: Ok... where is that word, so does that mean it should not move java forward
    because of conflicts.. Harmony was an issue even years back, only now it popped
    out..Look at the merits of the language, and allow , ofcourse there is certain
    closeness now [ actually its evident now ], and people (a lot), says they are
    going to shift to .NET, as if its completely open and comes with Apache Licence..

  content: "Is that it?\r\nThats your entire article?\r\n\r\nHow about you write something
    that proves the point in your title, explain your viewpoint, debate what points
    in the minutes lead you to believe what your title says and more importantly explain
    why you believe that.\r\n\r\nAh nevermind, your just another troll looking for
    free hits to your blog."

<p>In the <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/summaries/2010/October2010-public-minutes.html">published minutes</a> of the JCP EC meeting in Bonn last October, the complete (might I say <a href="http://thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=epic">epic</a>) failure of Oracle's Java Community stewardship becomes visible (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Doug asked Oracle to acknowledge that it was asking the ECs to <b>condone breaking the JSPA rules</b>. He said that if he was put in a position where he had to condone breaking the rules he would have to resign. Ken said that he understood, and would regret it if Doug resigned, but pointed out the <b>importance of allowing the conversation to go forward</b>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Doug Lea <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/jcp22oct10.html">resigned from the JCP EC</a> on 22 October 2010.</p>
<p>How is <b>that</b> for <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=61409#341434">being positive and constructive</a>?</p>
