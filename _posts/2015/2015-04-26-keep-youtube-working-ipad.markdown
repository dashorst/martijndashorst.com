title: How to keep YouTube working on your first gen iPad
---

YouTube is shutting down version 2 of its API, effecitvely killing the
support for devices that have YouTube apps that haven't been updated to
use the newer version. This includes many 'Smart' TVs, and of course
the first iPad.

The YouTube API is used to search for, and serve videos to your
devices. The version 2 of the API provided limited ad support to
YouTube, which makes the site run. That combined with a declining
number of users of the old API version, made YouTube decide to shut
down the old version. This saves on a lot of maintenance on their part.

This decision leaves many parents without a working YouTube app on
their old, passed down iPad 1s. The first iPad is stuck at iOS 5.1 and
starting from iOS 6 Apple no longer provides their own YouTube app, nor
will Apple update the old YouTube app to use the newer version of the
YouTube API.

YouTube suggests using the mobile version of their website, but
considering that the Safari browser on the first iPad is also no longer
maintained and has many unfixed security issues, this is not a good
path to take.

Fortunately there seems to be a workaround to install an older version
of the official YouTube app on your iPad 1:

1. purchase the official YouTube app on a supported device
2. on your iPad 1 go to App Store Â» Purchased
3. search for YouTube
4. click the download button

Your iPad will ask you to download an older version of the app, because
the current version requires iOS 6.

5. Confirm the download of the older version
6. $$$ profit

This will install a new YouTube app on your iPad with an updated (but
older) YouTube icon (white shield with black "You" and a red button
with white "Tube"). 

Enjoy while it lasts!
