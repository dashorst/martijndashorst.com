Unreal what happens to Brianna Wu. I admire her will to continue to
fight the good fight and I hope she'll be safe. Nobody deserves what
she has to go through. This is from 9 days ago:

> This weekend, a man wearing a skull mask posted a video on YouTube
> outlining his plans to murder me. I know his real name. I documented
> it and sent it to law enforcement, praying something is finally
> done. I have received these death threats and 43 others in the last
> five months.

Read the whole article and be appalled at the threats and vitriol she
recieves for being a woman in tech.
