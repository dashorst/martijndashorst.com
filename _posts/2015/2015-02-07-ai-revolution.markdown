In the category of interesting things to read when you have some time,
[this first part of a series](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) 
by Tim Urban should be on your list:

> Itâ€™s most intuitive for us to think linearly, when we should be
> thinking exponentially. If someone is being more clever about it, they
> might predict the advances of the next 30 years not by looking at the
> previous 30 years, but by taking the current rate of progress and
> judging based on that.
>
> [...]
>
> And everything we just mentioned is still only taking in stagnant
> information and processing it. To be human-level intelligent, a
> computer would have to understand things like the difference between
> subtle facial expressions, the distinction between being pleased,
> relieved, content, satisfied, and glad, and why Braveheart was great
> but The Patriot was terrible.

Read it all. [Part 2 is also available](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html).
