title: Is Blendle the Savior of Traditional Media?
---

Ever since we invited [Alexander Kl√∂pping][1] to our [company's
conference][2] as a keynote speaker I have been following his
endeavors. He's a busy fellow and does some amazing stuff. He's created
the [University of the Netherlands][3], a televised series of lectures
rich in media by renowned professors. And he created a startup that is
shaking up old media.

[Blendle][4] strives to revolutionize the way you consume news using
micropayments in a sensible way. Blendle has contracted with several
traditional newspapers and magazines (mostly in the Netherlands and
Belgium), and is now increasing its reach across the atlantic ocean
with content from the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.

The idea is that you can read an article for a small amount of money--a
micro-payment. So one article could set you back ‚Ç¨0.19 and another
‚Ç¨0.59. The price depends on the publisher, the content and demand.

### Curated content combined with technology

The site features a lot of curated content and automated trending
content. Of course any article you read is accompanied by a list of
related articles.

Blendle's setup wizard lets you create your own curated list of
publications. The publications you have selected will be featured in a
section called "My Blendle" and will list the most popular articles.
You can also select categories that will form the top menu bar and the
site will select the trending and popular articles for each category:

![Blendle top menu bar showing categories][i2]

For example I picked "Tech", "Big Interviews", "Foreign", "Science",
"Media" and "Education" as my categories, as shown in the prior image.

When you want "Share on the Interwebs" Blendle has you covered,
allowing you to share links to articles through social media (Twitter,
Facebook and LinkedIn), the platform itself or through email.

### Engage more with the daily newsletters

You'll recieve a curated list of articles of all morning editions in
your inbox. You'll also receive a message when a new issue of a
magazine is published, and one message at the end of the week with an
overview of the most important and popular articles. 

![Blende daily newsletter][i3]

Of course you can opt out of these messages with a familiar "Recieve
too much mail from us? Click here to unsubscribe of this daily
newsletter". The preferences page on their site has several options for
customizing your need to stay informed.

Each daily message ends with a nice "Psst, this is also noteworthy"
suggestion for some tongue in cheek content, making the newsletter bit
more entertaining. For example:

> **Pssssssst!** Eva had an affair with a co-worker just after getting
> married. The affair stopped and her marriage was saved, but then Eva
> [_ran into her co-worker by chance_][5]

Of course this is click bait, but the Blende team appears to use it as
a form of satire rather than a monetization strategy.

### Readers can have their cake and eat it too

The platform is thought through very well: when you are already a
subscriber to a participating newspaper you get all their articles for
free on blendle--you already paid for them. You still get access to all
other articles from other publishers, and there's no risk of paying for
an article twice.

![Buy an issue or use an existing subscription with Blendle][i4]

When you read an article you can get the whole issue where it appeared
in (e.g. the saturday newspaper) at a discount: the amount you already
spent on the articles of that issue. While I haven't tried it, it
wouldn't surprise me that when you buy enough articles to offset the
cost of the complete issue, it unlocks the issue automatically.

### Satisfaction guarantee or your money back

When you read an article but don't like it, or the price doesn't fit
the article in your opinion, Blendle will gladly refund you. You're
only asked a simple question: why you want your money back. Blendle
provides you with a list of prepared answers, or provide your own
feedback for the author and publisher.

![Satisfaction Guarantee or your money back][i5]

The ease of getting a refund makes it risk free for clicking on
articles. The price of newspaper articles is low enough to ignore the
cost and are pretty much on par what you'd want to pay. Articles from
magazines (looking at you Viva) are often priced too high in my short
experience with the platform.

### Trending news on your mobile

Blendle also released an app for mobile called "Blendle Trending". It
currently only shows the curated list of trending articles, and your
reading list. It was launched as a single day public beta on the App
Store for iOS. The app works, but is very limited in its use when
compared to the web site. I expect the app to become the major
interaction vector for Blendle really soon.

### Awesome design

The design of the website (and app) is gorgeous. The articles look
good, are nicely typesetted using good readable fonts not unlike the
original publication's type face. In fact the website loads about 45
different type faces in multiple weights.

The user experience is great too. The tone of voice is familiar,
friendly. It might be a bit too familiar for some folks, but it didn't
bother me. As the site is aimed at the 20 something crowd I think they
hit the sweet spot.

### Conclusion

The Blendle team has created a really interesting platform for the
future of publications, enticing youngsters to read background articles
that were previously hidden inside old media. Who has time to read
magazines, news papers and other publications in our age of 140
character snippets? Who even has time to read 140 character snippets
when a couple of üòúüéì‚úàÔ∏è will do?

Blendle has crafted a great experience to entice not only the
youngsters but also the old media. Springer and the New York Times are
on board as investors and have their publications available through the
site. The team has grown from 3 to 40 in a very short time and is one
of the Netherlands' most successful start ups.

I'm just a recent user of Blendle, but I'll keep checking their site
and application for more interesting news every day, consuming it a
micropayment at a time.
