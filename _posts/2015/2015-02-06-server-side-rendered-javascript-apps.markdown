The death of server-side rendering has been greatly exaggerated. 
Ember.js developer Tom Dale:

> Say what you will about server-rendered apps, the performance of
> your server is much more predictable, and more easily upgraded,
> than the many, many different device configurations of your
> users. Server-rendering is important to ensure that users who are not
> on the latest-and-greatest can see your content immediately when they
> click a link.

Interesting things brewing in the Ember.js space.
