A brilliant piece by Robert Moore:

> A few weeks ago I saw a car accident - two people went through an
> intersection at the same time. Both slammed on their brakes at the
> same time and collided. Fortunately no one was seriously injured.
>
> But then it occurred to me - if they had just gone through the
> intersection, they wouldnâ€™t have collided. The brakes CAUSED the
> accident!
