title: "Open Graph Protocol Headers Enabled"

From [this article about Open Graph Headers for Mastodon](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2023/02/mastodon-and-open-graph/) I thought that I also needed to update my blog to make it more friendly for Mastodon as that works with standards rather than trying to define them.

So I've updated my blog template to use [open graph protocol headers](https://ogp.me) identifying the blog posts. I also updated the default protocol for my blog to be HTTPS instead of HTTP (so 2017).

Here's to hoping the updated headers make my blog posts preview prettier on Mastodon!
