I'm becoming more and more a fan of htmx, and there's a companion book written by the author(s) of htmx:

[Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems)

>The revolutionary ideas that empowered the Web
>
> A simpler approach to building applications on the Web and beyond with htmx and Hyperview
>
> Enhancing web applications without using SPA frameworks
