<p>I've been preoccupied lately with the support of a very special personal release. July 7th 2009 our son Liam was born. He is a tiny baby (44cm, 2310 grams at delivery), but growing healthily. As any parent will attest to, it is a lot of hard but rewarding work. Even though Liam is still no programmer&mdash;he doesn't (yet) transform coffee into code, he is getting the basics of transforming warm liquids (milk) into other stuff (full diapers).<br />
[caption id="attachment_455" align="alignnone" width="420" caption="Liam sucking on God\'s gift to new parents: the pinky"]<img src="http://martijndashorst.com/blog/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_1102-1.JPG" alt="Liam sucking on God&#039;s gift to new parents: the pinky" title="Liam Dashorst" width="420" height="280" class="size-full wp-image-455" />[/caption]<br />
My wife Diana did a wonderful job giving birth to Liam, and she's now excelling at the toughest job of all: being a full-time mom for a 3 weeks old baby. No sleep (for mommy), no time to wash (for mommy), no time to eat (for mommy), etc.</p>
<p>So if I don't answer your comments, emails or other pings, don't feel offended: I just don't have time to even read your messages because the next diaper needs changing.</p>
