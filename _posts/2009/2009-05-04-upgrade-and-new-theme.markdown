<p>Just upgraded Wordpress to the latest and greatest (stable version), and took the liberty of downloading and installing a new theme. I'm hoping that the new Wordpress makes the site faster and easier to maintain.</p>
<p>I'm trying to find a good plugin to manage a conference: CfP, publishing the schedule, registering attendants, etc. Our company website runs on Wordpress, so a Wordpress plugin would be great. If not, I'll have to convince the powers that be to move to RadiantCMS and use the <a href="https://github.com/farra/apachecon-consite">ApacheCon conference plugin</a>, created by J. Aaron Farr.</p>
