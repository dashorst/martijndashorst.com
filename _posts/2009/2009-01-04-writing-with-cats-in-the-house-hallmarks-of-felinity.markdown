<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://officialpibgorn.livejournal.com/">Brooke McEldowney</a>'s work. His drawings are really nice and his style depicts the movement and grace of his characters perfectly. The most popular series is the <a href="http://comics.com/9_chickweed_lane/">9 Chickweed Lane</a> comic, which often surpasses funny and becomes hilarious.</p>
<p>
As a cat owner I really enjoy the special care and attention Brooke puts into one of the characters of 9 Chickweed Lane: the Siamese cat named Solange. In an ongoing series of sub plots called "Hallmarks of Felinity" Brooke depicts the character of cats 100% spot on. I have read many books on the subject of cat character, but none of them can even get close to the way Brooke dissects the cat soul (no cats have been harmed I am sure).</p>
<p>
Today's comic depicts a situation all to familiar to me:</p>
