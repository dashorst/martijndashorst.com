<p>Today would have marked Maurice's 30th birthday, if it weren't for that <a href="http://martijndashorst.com/blog/2008/08/04/a-farewell-to-maurice-marrink/">unfortunate accident</a> almost a year ago. It is times like these when you remember the loss of a valued friend more so than normally. No more sharing of cake, taunting the additional year and celebrating life.</p>
<p>My iCal notified me yesterday of Maurice's upcoming birthday, and today again. It will keep on doing that next year, and the year after that...</p>
<p>Maurice you are sorely missed. My thoughts are with you and Michel and your family. Where ever you are, happy birthday!</p>
