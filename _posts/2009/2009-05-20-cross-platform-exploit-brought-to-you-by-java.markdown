<p>From <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1238767&cid=28022907">Slashdot</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>'This means you can write a 100% reliable exploit in pure Java. This exploit will work on all the platforms, all the architectures and all the browsers,'</i> &mdash;<br />
And the Java critics said total platform independence was impossible!</p></blockquote>
<p>(yes I know that this is only affecting OS X Java, the quote was just too good to waste).</p>
