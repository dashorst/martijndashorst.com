  content: "Hi Martijn.\r\n\r\nYou should try IntellJ Idea, subversion support there
    is bliss. \r\n\r\nIt works perfectly well out of the box, merging is very well
    handled, it supports automatic finding of branches and tags and whatever... It
    just works.\r\n\r\nOh, and there's a free license for open source products.  ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\nLuis"

    after a Subclipse update caused exceptions on each and every click. Now I am using
    Subversive as I was to annoyed to play the ?find all the update sites and correct
    plugin selection? game.\r\n\r\nSee, I feel with you ;)"

  content: "I have used both subclipse (in the past) and subversive (more recently)
    and I found that they \"just work\" (I do not do heavy branching and merging,
    though).\r\n\r\nThe problem with the classes folder... I think that one of the
    bundles in subversive update site just excludes anything generated by JDT. I can
    not tell for sure since I always add the target folder to the svn:exclude (even
    if my IDE does magic, other developers might use the command line). That fixes
    the problem from the start and seems like \"the right thing\".\r\n\r\nBut so many
    people complain about svn support in Eclipse, that I tend to think that there
    must be some truth on that."

    does take 2 update sites for subversive to work. They both are mentioned at the
    website, at the very same page!\r\nbtw: Subversive is based on Subclipse so they
    have a similar structure with the same, flexible, connector approach. The only
    difference may be that subclipse doesn't offer a separate site for the connectors!\r\n\r\nThe
    target folder *is* excluded by subversive JDT extenstion, but not in external
    tools, so just add it to the svn:ignore-list and you don't have any problems with
    it. That's standard subversion functionality, one should be expected to know.
    You can even do this with subversive (and subclipse, I think)!\r\n\r\nSure, both
    plugins aren't perfect and have their quirks, but the problems you mentioned are
    mostly RTFM problems."

  content: "WTF? What makes you assume that we don't exclude those directories using
    svn:ignore? Before you start claiming RTFM, STF and try to see that others may
    experience bugs you haven't. And why the hell does it require 2 update sites?
    Why not just one? Why isn't it the default SCM implementation that ships with
    Gallilleo (or whatever the next moon of saturn is)? \n\nThis is a rant. CVS integration
    in Eclipse has been excellent since the first days. SVN has been the replacement
    for everybody in the world for CVS for 4 years now? And still Eclipse can't provide
    us with the same level of SCM support for SVN. *That* is appalling and what I'm
    ranting about.\n\nI don't have time to start debugging every open source project
    I use and turns up a bug. I expect some things to just work, especially stuff
    that should have been around for 3 years and are supported by commercial open
    source developers (Eclipse is pay to play)"

  content: Our development team at Verafin uses SVN as our primary code reporitory
    and a majority of us use Eclipse with Subversive.  We have found the Subversive
    team provider to be a very effective tool for both managing change and diagnosing
    defects.  I've used Eclipse since 1.0 and Subclipse then Subversive since their
    original releases.  The install process could stand to be improved in 3.4 and
    has been in 3.5.  The Eclipse foundation listens and so does Polarion (the makers
    of Subversive).  Before venting public rage on their free products you should
    consider giving them constructive feedback in Bugzilla (which is integrated into
    Eclipse).  I've had my share of frustrations with both over the years, but through
    careful documentation and communication I have seen both teams resolve them in
    a timely fashion.

    a giant waste of time! And BTW, I don't reflexively hate Perforce. I'll use any
    good tool. And in fact, their support people are incredibly helpful. But their
    Eclipse plug-in is so bad (buggy, hard to use) that I actually had to stop working
    and spend the first couple weeks on my new job writing a subversion proxy for
    Perforce (which worked out very well). \r\n\r\nI don't have the problems you cite
    with Subclipse. Instead, I have a very annoying one which I can accept (especially
    if the other option is Perforce): every so many commits, it insists that I do
    an update for no reason. I do an update. Nothing changes (because I didn't need
    to do an update!). Then I commit and it works. It's a silly little dance that
    I truly don't understand, but I find it hard to believe it's a bug in subversion
    itself, so I'd hazard a guess that it must be the eclipse plugin."

  content: "I agree with those who say it does NOT \"just work\" and ignore posts
    from anyone who appears to have no problem with it, since clearly many who do
    due diligence have problems.  And so do I.\r\n\r\nI have spent several hours many
    times researching how to do various things with Subclipse and Subversive.  In
    the end, I usually am able to get one or the other to install and do many things.\r\n\r\nBut
    there is one thing I cannot do.  Perhaps someone can point me at a resource to
    explain how.\r\n\r\nSpecs: Eclipse 3.5 \"Galileo\".  Mac OSX 10.5.7 Tiger.  The
    below applies to Subversive.  I've tried Subclipse with similar results too.\r\n\r\nI
    want my Eclipse project to be under ~/workspace/BLAH, but I want my SVN working
    copy OF A PARTICULAR FOLDER in the project to be at ~/who-cares/SVN/project-a.
    \ Because, that's where it's always been, and why should I move it to make Eclipse
    happy?  I don't care if the .project and all that are not under SVN - all the
    stuff I care about are in project-a\r\n\r\nSo, I've tried to do the \"New / Folder
    / Advanced ... / Link to folder in the file system\" to link to project-a.  The
    fact that the project-a folder is an SVN working copy is not detected.  There
    are posts on the new which basically say, this is expected because Linked Folder
    is an Eclipse concept ... blah blah.  This is a moot point.  The folder itself
    is under SVN - but the whole project is not.  I just want Subversive to recognize
    that and allow me to control THAT ONE FOLDER in my project.\r\n\r\nSo OK, instead
    of using Eclipse Linked Folders, I decide to do a symbolic link at the OS level
    - so I do \"ln -s ~/project-a project-a\" in the ~/workspace/BLAH (project) folder
    - same result."

    as I can't get the damn thing to install at all. \r\n\r\nThere really is no excuse
    for this being so hard. Isn't hooking an IDE up to a SCM system absolutely central
    to its utility? Why is this such an unloved child, while so much work goes on
    on less important stuff every release? Isn't anyone embarrassed that it's easier
    to just go use the command line Subversion client than fighting with it inside

    years using CVS and found it to be an excellent IDE.  Tonight I decided to work

    the nightmare of getting Subversion installed began (I'm using Ganymead).\r\n\r\nI'll
    admit that maybe some of my problems are due to the fact I'm use to working with
    CVS and don't really know anything about SVN, but really WHY doesn't the subversion
    plugin just install and work like the reliable old CVS one?\r\n\r\nAfter wasting
    several hours playing a delightful game of \"hunt the update site\" I now have
    error messages referring to SVN connectors, whatever the hell they are.  Following
    instructions I've managed to get everything installed but still the connector
    problems... Arrr!\r\n\r\nI'm amazed at how bad the support for SVN is within Eclipse,

    Every year or so I try it again, and after some time of agony go back to CVS,

  content: "My experience with Subclipse is that it's trickier to learn how to work
    with than it should be, and that if you don't take the time to learn its quirks,
    you can get yourself into trouble.  Otoh if you _do_ take that time, it works
    very well.  I've only run into two issues:  (1) Rarely but occasionally the Subclipse
    view will get out of sync with the checkout, a glitch that can be fixed simply
    by restarting Eclipse; and (2) Changing svn properties with Subclipse requires
    an extra update step, again to keep Subclipse in sync with the checkout.  Those
    two minor flaws aside, Subclipse works just as it should.\r\n\r\nSummary: not
    100% perfect, but highly usable IF you're willing to take a couple of hours to
    learn how to use it.\r\n\r\nI currently run Galileo \"IDE for Java Developers\"
    (+ updates) and  Subclipse 1.6.5 and CollabNet Merge Client 1.10.0, along with
    misc other 3rd party plugins. I run regularly on all three Eclipse platforms:
    linux (CentOS 5.x), windows (XP and 7) and osx (10.5 and 10.6).\r\n\r\nSo far
    I haven't found any reason to try Subversive, so no comments on that package."

  content: "You would think eclipse developers would be intelligent enough to integrate

    support for SVN and it doesn't \"just work\". The whole system is not user friendly,
    poorly design, slow, and full of exceptions and crashes. Eclipse fanboys want
    to tout that it \"just works\" for them but the reality is, it SUCKS."

  content: Used to working with Microsoft Team Foundation Service, I am horrified
    by the state of Eclipse/Subversion. It may that I am ignorant, but simple things
    like committing and resolving conflicts result in internal errors and shitloads
    of bugs coming out. Even if I am ignorant, that's no way to present errors.

<p>Eclipse is a great IDE, but the state of subversion support is appalling. Both subclipse and subversive are buggy as hell, and I'd rather not touch either of them with a 10 feet pole.</p>
<p>Installing subversive is a futile exercise in "find all the update sites and correct plugin selection". Subversive also is unable to keep the target/classes directory out of the synchronize view, which makes committing changes rather challenging.</p>
<p>Installing subclipse is much better than installing subversive: just add subclipse's update site and install all plugins. No hunting for external sites, and no chance of installing the wrong stuff (I'm on OS X, so the win32 HL binaries are of no use to me). But again the team synchronize view is borked. This time subclipse won't remove all updated files, double clicking on a folder throws an exception, etc.</p>
<p>I know that GIT is the SCM du jour, but please can someone at eclipse.org take note and finally implement a working, pleasant integration with subversion? Is that so much to ask after 5 years of Subversion availability?</p>
